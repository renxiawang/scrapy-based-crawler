It starts out in a small village outside of Aliahan on Tialah's 16th birthday. She's called into the house by her mother because an old sage called Master Yogi came to see her. Master Yogi gives her a red jewel necklace and sash.\nShe runs out, with her slimes Chi Chi and Ka Ka, to see Abel who is out fishing at the lake. Abel is trying to catch a gigantic fish (what is it with Toriyama and big fish?) when she arrives. After getting thoroughly beaten by the fish, Tialah asks Abel to try out her new invention (some sort of hang glider). It works, sort of. Abel rides it for a while until the wings melt and goes right into the lake. Tialah goes into the lake to help him and while underwater they come across a sunken stone tablet. They read about the Legendary Dragon and how it can be released with the Red Stone and sealed again with the Blue Stone. Whoever drinks the blood of the Dragon is awarded eternal life, but the Dragon can only be cut with a special sword and the blood can only be caught in a special cup.\nThey head to shore to see the flying fortress of Gaim arrive over them. Out of the fortress flies Moor, a fish like magician who rode in a pink energy ball. After a failed attempt to fight him, Tialah and Abel are pulled into Gaim and wind up face to face with Baramos. With sheer will, Baramos levitates Abel and throws him into the walls. He is then ejected from the fortress. Before he falls, Tialah tells Chi Chi to look after Abel. Defeated and injured, Abel falls into the lake with one of Tialah's feathers from her hang glider landing on his face. Abel swears to get her back at any cost.\nRealizing that Tialah knows nothing about the Red Stone around her neck, Baramos sends Moor to attack the village and retrieve information. Mokomoko and a priest nurse Abel back to health and the priest tells Abel that Tialah is carrying the Red Stone and only he can get her back. He gives him the Blue Stone, which is attached to a headband. During the village attack, Moor finds Tialah's parents and Master Yogi. He puts them into a trance and learns details of the Dragon from Master Yogi. During Moor's escape, he leaves behind a Giant Anteater (from DQ III) to wreck everything. A recovered Master Yogi manages to call upon the power of the Dragon to give Abel the opportunity to kill it. But the ordeal is too much for Master Yogi to handle and passes away.\nAbel and Mokomoko leave for Aliahan castle to receive more information from the king. Along the way, the wizard Yanak and the fighter Daisy join their cause. As always, Baramos is one step ahead of them. They receive a map of how to find the Dragon, but it is stolen by Baramos.\nThis is where the 13 U.S. episodes stop at, however the story itself continues on. The Red Temple which Baramos was heading to. Baramos has already left and had trashed the place. There, Abel has a vision of the Dragon being released and it being sealed up again. When the vision is over, the group receives the Sailor's Bone (seen in DQIII).\nGaim has gone back to Escheat to be recharged. It is here that Zoom, Baramos' master is introduced. I was told later on that Mokomoko gets into a fight with a Metal Slime. It breaks his clubs and he has to wind up buying new weapons. After crossing the bridge into the other countries and going on a few side quests, the group finally stocks up on new weapons and supplies.\nTialah and Deeding escape Gaim without Baramos noticing. But once again, Abel had boarded Gaim to fight Baramos. Tialah had just had the resurrection power transferred to her and she meets the rest of the group. Tialah and Deeding had been teleported away before the rest of the group found Abel. Abel had gotten the crud beaten out of him again. This time the fight left him in a coma. Yanak took him to his master, Zanak (seen in episode 11), to be revived. While Able is being revived, Tialah takes his place in the party.\nWhen Able is healed, Yanak decides to stay with Zanak to train and improve his magic skills. After this, Able fights a man under the control of Baramos. After Able defeats him, Able learns that the man is his father, but he soon dies in an attack from one of Baramos' generals. The group then winds up back in Aliahan and Abel meets up with the king of Aliahan. He gives Abel a map that allows the Blue and Red Stones to track each other. The priest also gives Tialah the knife in order to to cut the Legendary Dragon. She leaves with Deeding and Mokomoko to find the cup needed to summon the Dragon.\nWhile Abel, Daisy, and Daisy's brother Toby search for the orbs and Liamland, the come across Hagon and Shido (Hargon and Malroth from DQII). To help out in the fight, Yanak returns to the group. When Hagon is defeated, Able is lead to the shrine of Ramia (from DQ3). He places the orbs and the egg hatches and Ramia is born.\nMeanwhile, Tialah finds the Holy Cup and General Ludolph returns and Baramos powers him up. Abel's group finds the Holy Sword and Ludolph attacks. Of course, Abel defeats him.\nLater on, Baramos returns to Zoom. Zoom gives Baramos a boost of energy causing him to change his form and he's now twice as powerful. In one of the final battles, Toby, Zanak, and Deeding are killed.\nTialah resurrects the Legendary Dragon at Aliahan. But, it's only a baby! Baramos steals the Holy Sword and Cup and cut the throat of the Dragon. Before he can drink the blood, Mokomoko knocks the cup out of his hand prompting Baramos to kill him. The Dragon grows to an adult size. The Dragon attacks Baramos and manages to kill Moor and destroy Gaim. The Dragon and the Red and Blue stones unite to form Roto's armor, sword, and shield on Able. After a huge fight, Able finally defeats Baramos.", "The year is 1989. On ABC, at least in my area, one of the first examples of anime on a major network channel appears. This show had a run of a single season. Whatever it was that happened afterwards made this series very difficult to find, especially with over 10 years gone by since it was canceled.

This site is dedicated to being an upcoming resource on this all but lost piece of anime in America.\nThe primary artist involved in the Dragon Warrior series is none other than Akira Toriyama, most well known in America for his Dragon Ball Z series.

In this future universe (year 0158 on the Toward Stars Calendar), there are three kinds of people. First are the Space Forces. They are the law in the galaxy that strive to maintain peace and order. Second are the Pirate Guilds. These ruthless bands rob and plunder at will, flying in the face of the law and leaving chaos in their wake.\nIn between are the Outlaws. They are the free spirits of space. They go where they want, do what they want, and answer to no one but themselves.\nThis is the story of three significant points of interest: \n, a carefree man who will do anything for the good life; the XGP15A-II (re-christened the \n), a state-of-the-art grappler ship that happens to come into \n's possession; and the Galactic Leyline, a supposed treasure trove that everyone seeks...and the \n is destined to seek out.\nNote: One episode was not presented on US television due to nudity issues.", "Outlaw Star came out in 1998, the same year as \n and \n. Some critics have said that it suffers unfairly from the inevitable comparisons to these others, especially the latter.\nWhile I am very fond of \n, I don't think this is the case. Outlaw Star, considered on its own merits, is a mediocre space shonen adventure series with annoying characters who have no more depth than the animation cels they're painted on.\nPrincipal protagonist \n is a cheerfully sociopathic martial arts tough guy, a horndog, and a mouthy jerk. He has lots of scars; in fact, when he takes off his shirt, he looks like he's gone one-on-one with someone who brought a chainsaw to a fistfight. He's a hot-tempered musclebound moron. He seems to have a poorly developed grudge against space pirates. There's nothing more to him. Period. Full stop.\nHe's flying around space looking for a quick buck doing bounty-hunting jobs, preferably dead-or-alive bounties, and hunting for a McGuffin called the Galactic Leyline, which is mainly just a plot device to string 26 episodes together. He hunts and is hunted by recurring villains whose motivations are unclear and who mostly have no more psychological depth than he does.\nAccompanying him as he wades through gore on his quest for a quick buck, some nookie, and the Space McGuffin (not necessarily in that order) are four cardboard cutouts, straight from Central Casting:\nKid genius sidekick \n is a level-headed and precocious 11-year-old. He's a kid genius sidekick. You now know how he will react in any situation, and can probably predict most of his lines. Where are his parents? We don't know. Where did he come from? We don't know. How did he become the kid sidekick of a bloodthirsty, battle-scarred, violently antisocial bounty-hunter like \n? We don't know. Full stop.\nShy, soft-spoken android girl \n may have some feelings for \n, or not, but we don't get into her head, so it doesn't matter. She's sad and she simpers and she makes goo-goo eyes at \n. He rescues her a lot. He may feel something for her, or not. Full stop.\nExotic alien catgirl (complete with collar and bell, just in case the ears, tail, and constant \"nya! nya! nya nya!\" catgirl-accented Japanese were too subtle) \n is short-tempered, violent, superhumanly strong, and not very bright. One hopes she isn't representative of her species, who supposedly have conquered a vast interstellar empire. She's a half-wit, even stupider than \n. She's mainly there for comic relief and perhaps a bit of fanservice. She is voiced quite capably by Yuko Minamura, perhaps better known for portraying \n from \n; her performance stands out here, sort of like a maraschino cherry atop a turd. Her talent is wasted on material like this. Full stop.\nBeautiful sword-wielding assassin \n is an enigma. This is a characteristic she shares with, well, everybody else in this series. Who is this ravishing beauty? She's an \"Ultra Class A Assassin.\" What does that mean? We don't know. Why doesn't she have big honkin' shaggy eyebrows like everyone else? (All character design was by Takehito \"Big Honkin' Shaggy Eyebrows For Everybody, Even Women And Kids\" Ito.) We don't know. Where did she come from? We don't know. Why, in a retro-future straight out of a 1950s television sci-fi serial, does she always wear a kimono and obi, as if she'd just stepped out of medieval Japan? Why does this cool, competent (callous and cold-blooded, even) assassin with a fearsome reputation for light-years around freak out and lose her cool when she fights \n? We don't know. How did this petite and rather young-looking woman become such a superhuman expert with the sword? We don't know. Why did this woman, who presumably once had a mother and father who loved her, become an assassin for hire? We don't know. But at least she doesn't simper like \n, and she's not an idiot like \n. Full stop.\nDoes anyone else see a pattern developing here? We spend twenty-six episodes with these characters. Yet at the end we don't know anything about them that we didn't learn by the third time we see each of them. If any of them has an internal monolog, we never hear a word of it. When I watched \n, I learned about the characters and began to care about them. When I watched Outlaw Star, I noticed that it doesn't really matter what order you watch the episodes in, and I found some of the antagonists (particularly \n and her genetically engineered supercats, Kemi and Mata... all three of whom are rather brutally killed by \n, who doesn't bat an eyelash) to be far more appealing and far more sympathetic than our cheerfully homicidal, two-dimensional \"hero.\"\nEven the ending of the series feels like a cheat, as it opens the door to the possibility of a sequel. However, as it's been almost ten years at this point, I suppose we dodged that particular bullet. Be glad.\nIt's a shame, really. The Toward Stars universe looks like an interesting place, and has had a lot more thought and effort put into it than any of the characters who adventure in it. The existence of real, functioning magic (\"Tao sorcery,\" to be precise) pushes the mood of the series more towards fantasy than science fiction, I suppose, but it hardly matters, with such an unappealing, unsympathetic, simplistic protagonist.

While \n is out back one afternoon watering, a young man named Tohru Takamura arrives at the front gate. Tohru, a friend and relative whom the family hasn't seen since he was a young child, has come to live with the Sakumoto family while his mother recovers from her surgery. So when nobody answers the doorbell, Tohru decides to let himself through the gate. He then heads around to the back when he hears the water going, and catches his first glimpse of \n as fully developed woman. He stares in wonder as \n looks down the barrel of the hose, wondering why the water stopped. Then Tohru realizes that he's standing on the hose and quickly jumps off, inadvertently causing \n to get soaking wet, and giving him a very nice view of her breasts though her soaked t-shirt. Once she notices this, she totally clocks Tohru while screaming to her mom that there's a pervert after her. Apparently she forgot that her mom told her he was coming.\n\nIt isn't long before we find the two in school, and are introduced to \n's \"rival\", Chiaki. Chiaki is already jealous that the hot boy in class likes \n, so when Chiaki sees \n walking to school with another boy, Tohru, she becomes determined to do something to humiliate \n. And this \"something\" happens when class is out of session. Chiaki and her two female friends pin \n against a wall. Unbeknownst to an of them, Tohru had taken up a spot in a nearby tree to get some rest just a few minutes prior. When he hears the girls taunting \n, he leaps into action... only to trip and fall out of the tree, knocking himself unconscious. The girls continue their torture and begin to undress \n when Tohru comes to. He tries to yell out for \n, but his mouth is full of leaves, so the only thing that escapes is \"\n\". But upon hearing Tohru's cry, \n instantly undergoes some kind of mental transformation, changing from the sweet, shy girl we've come to know into \n, an assertive, self-confident woman with a kick-ass attitude who easily takes out all three of her aggressors!\nThe next morning Tohru can't stop talking about how she wiped out those three girls, but it seems \n can't remember a thing! Tohru is understandable confused, but explained everything that happened nonetheless. When he gets to the part where she told him to call her \"\n\", she again transforms into her self-assured alter-ego. That's when Tohru realizes that \n actually has a split personality, and that calling her name is what brings it out. This little \"trick\" comes in handy later on, especially during another one of Chiaki's attempts to humiliate her by stealing \n's bra panties during in swim class and then blackmailing a student into lifting up \n's skirt after she's gotten changed and returned to class. Luckily Tohru was able to call out \n just in the nick of time!\n\nThese types of encounters don't remain the focus of the story, however. Gradually the plot shifts over to the budding romance between Tohru and \n/\n, the woman's realization, understanding, and eventual interaction with her dual personalities, and eventually the discovery of how they came to be. Once that happens, Tohru comes up with a plan to hopefully merge the two back into one person. Will it work, or will these two completely separate people continue to reside in the same body? Or even worse, will one of them disappear forever? Well I'm not gonna tell you the outcome of Tohru's plan, just that he had a great time implementing it!\nThis is a sweet, softcore hentai title that actually has an interesting and enjoyable story. The art and animation is simple but effective enough, and helps to keep the mood light and carefree. Plus, there are a lot of funny moments scattered throughout, often accompanied by exagerated drawings of Tohru.

Anywho, as Yumeko is pleasuring Yukihito, sounds from outside begin to creep in... sounds of someone getting beat up. Yumeko seems concerned... briefly, though Yukihito in unphased, and simply has Yumeko continue as Getaro, the poor kid outside, gets pounded by three freaky lookin' students.\nNext, we cut to a hallway, where new transfer student Yoshijiro is walking to class with his instructor, Professor Kanako Sakamoto. Professor Sakamoto is attempting to subtly prepare him for all the graffiti he is about to witness on the walls of their classroom, but Yoshijiro is only focused on one thing: his teacher's big bouncing bosoms. As they arrive just outside the classroom, they're both shocked when one of the students, Mirai Aoi, busts out through the door wielding a baseball bat and goes flying past them screaming that she's going to beat someone to death. After catching Professor Sakamoto from falling (and getting and handful of boob in the process), he takes off after Mirai.\n\nYukihito and Yumeko are still having their fun when Mirai arrives on scene. After a few words, she ramps up to beat the crap out of the three freaks, but Yoshijiro arrives just in time to catch her bat and stop her from inflicting some series damage. Calling himself the \"Transfer Student of Justice\", he promptly steps in and gives one of the guys a solid boot to the head! Another one quickly takes off, but Yoshijiro catches the third guy before he can escape. Then, just as Yoshijiro's about to clobber him too, Yukihito and Yumeko come out... yes, fully clothed.\n\nSeems the devious two-some are up to something, as they report the incident, though not as Yoshijiro saving a fellow student from abuse. Oh no, they report it as Yoshijiro using inexcusable violence against the three theater club members for no reason. What are those sleazeballs up to? Soon, it becomes clear.... Yukihito wants Mirai, but she won't have anything to do with him. The whole thing was a setup to get her in trouble! And now Professor Sakamoto's entire class is in trouble! The punishment: to be decided later.\n\nAfterwards, Mirai and Yoshijiro discuss what just happened while walking along, attempting to figure out what exactly Yukihito is up to. Yoshijiro spies Getaro peeking around a corner them, and Getaro splits when he sees Yoshijiro notice. Yoshijiro takes off after him, but instead of finding the poor kid, he instead comes across a room with some unexpected sounds. The door is cracked open, so he takes a look inside, and is shocked by what he sees... two students, a guy and a girl, having a good old time together! Yoshijiro freaks when the girl notices him watching, but instead of screaming in terror, she just smiles and screams in pleasure.\n\nLater, as Yoshijiro is wandering the halls trying to find his way back to his classroom, the voice from a female student at the top of the stairs calls down to him. When he turns toward the voice, he is presented with a lovely view under her skirt of her pretty yellow panties as she makes mention that he must be the new transfer student.

Endowed with the intelligence and personalities encoded in Medals and equipped with a near-endless variety of Medaparts, these pet robots (or Medabots, as they are called) are the frequent companions of people around the world.\nLittle Ikki had always wanted to have a Medabot of his own. His chance came when he stumbled upon a lost Rare Medal. Scrounging together what he could, he bought an old Medapart kit, put it together with the medal, and the result was \n. And since then, life has never been the same.\nAnd as if Ikki and \n had trouble between themselves, they also have to constantly deflect the attention of other Medafighters (like Samantha and the Screws), try to figure out the mystery of the Phantom Renegade, and defeat the efforts of the infamous Rubberobo gang, who seem to have an eye on \n for some reason.\nAnd all this because all he wanted to do was become a Medafighter. Can't a 10-year-old kid have fun these days?", "Medabots: where young kids pit their robotic pals against each just because they're bored! Okay, so not really, but it's not far from the truth. In the world of Metabots, which apparently takes place sometime in the future, it seems that not only does everyone own a robot slave, but they also all use them to \"robattle\". So it's basically a Pokemon ripoff, replacing the annoyingly cute critters with mechanical monstrosities. And while both series are most definitely made for children, speaking as an adult male, Metabots is a bit easier to watch.\nAnywho, the protagonist of this series is a kid named Ikki (pronounced like \"Icky\"). He's all bummed because everyone at school has a Medabot except for him, and his mom refuses to buy him one, saying that he needs to save his money and buy one himself (boy if that doesn't bring back memories!)... so he does what any kid would do in that situation and hangs out at the store staring at the Medabots. One day the store owner takes pity on Ikki and offers to sell him an old model for the little money that Ikki has... and Ikki refuses! Seems kinda lame to me after the big fuss he made.\nTo be fair, the store owner was only offering to sell him a Medabot body, not a Medabot medal (which is like the equivalent of a brain or soul). After some mostly insignificant events, Ikki finds a Medabot medal, buys the Medabot body, and starts his wave of robot-on-robot violence! Of course, it soon becomes clear that there's something special about that mysterious Medabot metal, as Metabee (that's Ikki's Medabot) has much more personality than your average run-of-the-mill Medabot. If fact, he actually refuses to follows Ikki's commands at first. This changes as they realize how much they need each other.\nThere isn't a real flowing plot line here, as most episodes can be taken as they are, in whatever order. Each finds Ikki and pals going on some kind of minor adventure. In several of the episodes they wander far from school and stay out late and I can't help but wonder what is up with these kids' parents? For instance, in one episode the kids are out at night in a forest, and in another they follow their coach downtown. Is this sending the right message to kids? Well, at least they're using the buddy system!\nThe show does have some scenes which actually made me chuckle, such as seemingly every time there is a robattle about to happen, the referee pops out from some hidden area, which reminded me of Agent 13 from \n. There is some dialog between Ikki and Metabee which is occasionally more interesting than I would expect from such a show, but overall the characters and stories are all rather plain. Not a bad show for kids but adults will find it lacking.\nThe first season DVD box set released by \n is called \n, though technically it's not quite complete as they're missing Japanese episode 19 \"Once Frostbitten Twice Shy\" (ピンゲン南へ…), episode 20 \"Heavy Medal\" (レアメダルを奪え!), and episode 23 \"Bridge Over Troubled Squidguts\" (風と火の記憶). Apparently they must have realized this at some point, because attached to the front of the DVD box is a sticker that says \"The Complete First Season As Seen on Fox Kids\".\nAlso, there is no Japanese language track, unfortunately. This is understandable, though, since this is the series as it was released on Fox Kids, and thus it went through a few edits, so the Japanese track wouldn't always match up. I would much prefer an unedited version that did contain the Japanese language track, but that's not what this is. I did find it odd, however, that there was no subtitle track. There's really no reason not to put one in, except for that they didn't think it was worth the effort.\nThe following episode are included in the first season DVD box set:" ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1999–2000" ], "creator" : [ "Medarot Production" ], "company" : [ "Bee Train", "NAS", "Kodansha", "TV Tokyo" ], "title" : [ "Medarot", "Medarot Damashii" ], "director" : [ "Tensai Okamoto" ], "released" : [ "52 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/medabots/arcbeetle.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/medabots/henry.htm", "name" : "Hikaru Agata" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/medabots/karin.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/medabots/metabee.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/medabots/peppercat.htm", "name" : "Peppercat" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/medabots/rokusho.htm", "name" : "Rokusho" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Comedy", "Action" ] } }

First, her father dies and untimely death. Then, her mother literally works herself to death in order to pay for Momoko's tuition. And after her mother passes, Momoko no longer has any way to pay for her tuition, other than possibly selling her most treasured possession, the late mother's ring, a family heirloom. Surprisingly, a fellow student named Takaaki steps in at just the right time, and makes her an offer she can't refuse. He will pay for her tuition and all of her expenses if she agrees to be his live-in maid. So she can continue her schooling which her mother worked so hard to allow, she gets a free place to stay, she doesn't have to give up her ring, and all she has to do is a little housework. Yeah, right.\n\nSo just when Momoko thinks things are starting to look up, she discovers that her maid duties include more than just cleaning up... if you know what I mean (and if you've ever watched any \n hentai, then I'm sure you do). So Momoko finds herself trapped into being a sex slave for the twisted Takaaki, catering to his every carnal desire. And if that wasn't bad enough, she also finds herself being accosted by a couple guys at school under the orders of a fellow female student named Lulu. The reason? Well, Lulu just happens to find herself in love with Takaaki, and is jealous that Momoko gets to spend so much time with him! Man, could things possibly get any worse little Miss Maid Momoko? Yes, yes they could.\n\nBut before things get worse for Momoko, they get worse for two other female students, Mana, the student body president whom Takaaki caught shoplifting, and Chika, a fellow student who requires financial assistance to help keep her parents' business afloat. The two lovely ladies just became the newest members of Takaaki's maid staff. Now Momoko must choose which one Takaaki will train first. And her decision is... the beautiful student body president, Mana. For her training, Takaaki decides to try out a little bondage... and to everyone's surprise, she likes it! Though I don't think anyone was more surprised that Mana herself. Chika's turn will have to wait until later that night, when Takaaki has trouble getting to sleep.\n\nIn the second volume, Takaaki tries his had at erotic asphyxiation, but is ultimately disappointed when Momoko looses consciousness too quickly. He then decides to hold a contest, whereby Momoko and Chika must pleasure each other, and whoever has an orgasm first loses their dinner for the night. As expected, the more experienced Momoko triumphs, and is treated to a reward... Takaaki-style. And just when you thought they wouldn't introduce any new characters for Takaaki to play with, in walks Lulu, who begs Takaaki to let her be one of his maids. Hey, the more the merrier! So I guess it makes sense that he would invite Momoko's best friend, Yurika, over for dinner.\n\nWhen Yurika arrives at the door, Momoko is shocked to see her, and quickly tries to convince her to leave. But alas, we all know that doesn't happen. The next thing we know, Yurika is tied up by her arms while Chika goes to work on her. And as if seeing her best friend at the mercy of Takaaki wasn't enough, in comes Akiyoshi, another of Momoko's friends. He has always been kind and polite to her, treating her with respect, and saving her on occasion from Lulu's hoodlum's. Unfortunately for Akiyoshi, his parents are also in debt, and so in he's brought, by Lulu, to do whatever Takaaki wishes... and Takaaki wishes him to take Yurika, while Momoko watches. And so I say again, can't this girl catch a break?!\n\nAh, but then a strange thing happens. The next day at school, Lulu meets with Momoko to make her a proposition... stop being Takaaki's maid, leave his house, and her parents will pay for all of her tuition and expenses. Momoko is shocked to here this, but then tells her about the ring, the ring that Takaaki now has. So when Lulu assures Momoko that she can get the ring back, she is stunned by Momoko's silence. For it seems that somehow, in some way, Momoko has become fond of her current life, addicted to the pleasures that Takaaki provides her. It is a shocking realization, and one that Lulu absolutely does not want to hear. So if Momoko won't leave on her own free will, then Lulu's going to take matters into her own hands!" ], "jp_info" : { "genre" : [ "Hentai" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "title" : [ "Meido no Yakata Zetsubou-hen", "Mansion Maid Chapter of Despair" ] } }

Running out of money at the Tokyo tower telescope, \n is given change by a mysterious young girl, later introduced as \n, wearing a neighboring school's uniform. \n rushes to thank the girl, but is stopped by a crowd of students. Trying to pass through, \n glances towards a girl with long blue hair, again from an neighboring school.\nSuddenly there is a flash of light as they hear the prayer of a young woman calling for help from the legendary \"Magic Knights\", and the three find themselves suspended in mid-air over the land of Cefiro, filled with mountains and forests. Falling, they land upon a seemingly friendly flying fish. The three young girls are brought to safety on land, still confused as to their whereabouts. However, \n, the smallest of the three, suggests an introduction.\n and \n are at first shocked to find \n the same age as themselves (which is 14 years), for her young appearance is misleading, but their attentions quickly turn to the figure of a rather short man holding a magical staff that had appeared behind them. Introducing himself as Dosh (loosely translated as \"master\") \n, a powerful user of magic, he explains that \n, \n, and \n are the legendary Magic Knights, destined to save the world of Cefiro whose captured ruler, Princess Emeraude, is in the posession of the dark priest \n. Since the princess had been captured, the land of Cefiro has been plagued by monsters and demons, and will soon deteriorate if Emeraude Hime fails to be returned. \n is the first to respond exclaiming that she is willing to sacrifice in order to become a Magic Knight. Upon hearing \n's eager response Clef raises his staff to give the newly found Magic Knights their magic, but has only time to bless \n as they are attacked by Dosh Clef's now evil apprentice, Alecone. Yelling the incantation \"Summon beast!\" Clef commands the three to board the magic griffin and escape to the safety of the forest where they will meet Presea, a gifted maker of weapons. Reluctantly the Magic Knights agree to escape as Clef challenges Alecone, in an even battle. Alecone leaves Clef to pursue \n and the others, in hopes of ending the Magic Knights before the legend can be fulfilled.\nSuddenly, from behind Dosh Clef, the evil priest \n appears, and turns the powerful Clef to stone.\nAboard the griffin \n senses that something is wrong as she thinks of the sorcerer that had risked his life to help them, but helpless she can only pray for his safety. Alecone appears riding her magical white horse through the air, calling incantations. Determined to survive and save the world of Cefiro \n summons the power within herself and counter-attacks \n's minion with a new found strength, becoming the first to find her magic. The Magic Knights are able to escape, thankful for their safety. However, Alecone is not yet defeated.\n, \n, and \n's thoughts turn to finding Presea, maker of weapons. Finding themselves at the opening of a dense forest, the Magic Knights step inside, but the griffin that had transported them there mysteriously disappears in a puff of smoke. At first \n is confused, but after attempting to use her magic \"arrow of fire\", she realizes along with her new-found friends that magic can not be used in such an forest. Entering further into the woods, they encounter what appears to be the home of Presea. At first they are unable to find an entrance, but then the three girls accidently stumble across it. The Magic Knights are a little hesitant to enter her home uninvited, but proceed inside calling unanswered apologies. Much to their surprise, a cage is dropped over them, as a golden-haired woman appears chanting madly and exclaiming proudly how she had captured Mokana, a white rabbit-like creature with the ability to summon, which has been reeking havoc in her study. Seeing that the ones inside her trap are not Mokana, Presea realizes that \n, \n, and \n are the legendary Magic Knights, as only they would be able to pass through the entrance leading to her home. But before Presea is able to give them the weapons that they have been searching for, a low rumbling noise sounds as a monster appears attacking her study. The Magic Knights run in pursuit of Presea and are led to a darkened room laden with various weapons. Pausing, the three are confused to which weapons to choose, but upon Presea's command they close their eyes, concentrate, and their three destined weapons rise from the rest and go to them.\nFor \n, a bow and arrow. For \n and \n, a pair of swords.\nWith their combined strength the Youma is defeated. Thanking Presea the Magic Knights set off in search of the mineral \"Escudo\", from which Presea will be able to mold their true weapons, the Machines, as well as to free the magical forest from the powers of the dark stone implanted in it's center, to save the princess Emeraude from the clutches of evil, and finally to fulfill their destiny as the Legendary Magic Knights..." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1994–95" ], "creator" : [ "Clamp" ], "company" : [ "Studio CCLAMP", "TMS", "Kodansha" ], "title" : [ "Maho Kishi Rayearth", "Magic Knight Rayearth" ], "director" : [ "Toshihiro Hirano" ], "released" : [ "20 TV eps.", "; 29 TV eps.", "3 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/eagle.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/ferio.htm", "name" : "Ferio" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/fuu.htm", "name" : "Fuu Hououji" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/geo.htm", "name" : "Geo Metro" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/hikaru.htm", "name" : "Hikaru Shidou" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/innova.htm", "name" : "Innova" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/clef.htm", "name" : "Dosh Clef" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/mokona.htm", "name" : "Mokona" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/emeraude.htm", "name" : "Princess Emeraude" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/umi.htm", "name" : "Umi Ryuzaki" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/zagato.htm", "name" : "Zagato" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/magic_knight_rayearth/zazu.htm", "name" : "Zazu Torque" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ] } }

She must select another person in another world, grant them magical powers, and help guide them in how to use them to make their world a better place. At this time we are introduced to all of the characters that will make up our world and how they have changed from the other series to this one.

Around the same time, \n's tendrils have already slithered into the world and have picked \n to become \n's magic girl rival.\n\nThe action heats up when \n and \n are turned into Love-Love monsters by \n and start fighting over \n, endangering his life. \n ends up saving the day (technically) as she always will, and leads us into the next episode.\nEpisode two starts off with a power hungry, psychotic, computer genius. (Bill Gates?!) His name is \n. \n wants to 'standardize' all computers, and afterwords he wants to standardize the people who use them as well. He controls 95% of the worlds computers, except for Japan. Anyway, \n and \n appear and try to 'help' \n with his conquering of the world. Meanwhile, at the Kawai residence... \n needs a new karoake machine. \n goes out to buy one, but instead he buys a new computer, the Mach8 system. The fastest on Earth. He also goes to buy some software. \n looks on, and realizes that it's not using his software. \n gets really angry and calls on \n.\n sees this and transforms into \n! \n realizes \n's plan and her and \n team up briefly to stop \n. \n appears and persuades \n to go back to \n's side.

The art is very simple, using a lot of very basic shapes and crisp colors, the animation looks like it was made for a Flash player, are neither of the two main characters actually speak. Plus, it is unbelievable cute, more so than even \n. And yet, despite what you might expect for a series with such an extreme cuteness factor, this show goes down like a cool drink of water. It's easy to watch, easy to laugh at, and will simply brighten your day.\n\nThe main focus of the show is on a 10 year old girl named Pucca, and her ever-lasting quest to make a ninja boy named Garu into her boyfriend. Garu, on the other hand, wants nothing to do with Pucca, and typically spends most of the episode trying to run away from her. And oddly enough, neither of these two main characters even speak! All thoughts and emotions are conveyed by body language and floating icons that pop up. Any fan of anime will recognize the use of icons to indicate emotions, such as hearts popping up to indicate love, but this show takes it to the extreme!\n\nThankfully, all the rest of the characters speak, and let me tell you, there are quite a few of them! My personal favorite is Garu's best friend, Abyo. He's modeled after Bruce Lee, and can often be found ripping off his shirt whenever the mood suits him (which is typically AT LEAST once per episode). Pucca's best friend is Ching, who often seems super-cheerful and always has a bird sitting atop her head. And what would a show be without villains?! The best of these is the evil ninja Tobe, Garu's main rival. He has a wicked-looking x-shaped scar right between his eyes and commands an entire clan of ninja lackeys... but despite all this, he still lacks the skill needed to take down Garu... or even Pucca for that matter. But he does have some of the funniest quotes in the show.\nThere are other villains, such as Muji, a man obsessed with his moustache, and the Vagabond Ninja Clan, which consist of Chief, Clown, and Shaman. Ring Ring could also be considered a baddie, though to a much lesser extent. She's basically a spoiled, selfish rich girl who wears traditional Chinese robes and gets this gnarly red-and-white design on her face when she gets mad. She considers herself Pucca's rival, though I'm unsure if Pucca actually sees her in that way. Also making frequent appearances is Santa Claus (though not as a villain). I guess the man's gotta do something when he's not on duty for Christmas.\n\nAt any rate, this show is a great melting pot of cuteness, comedy, martial arts action, weirdness, and kisses... lots of kisses! It is great entertainment that works for both kids and adults. Definitely check it out if you have the chance. Don't trust me? Just check out the \n, or this \n. You can learn more at \n.

His name is synonymous with quick, efficient death: the world's most lethal assassin, Golgo 13.\nHowever, this time around, the hitman has become the hit when he takes out the son of a wealthy oil tycoon. Leonard Dawson is now sparing no expense and taking no chances. He wants Golgo 13 dead...\nCreated by Takao Saito, the world of Golgo 13 is a world of international intrigue where his bullets punctuate the atmosphere. Though not the first time Golgo 13 had appeared on film (there was a live-action feature titled \n made some time prior), \n is his first appearance in anime, faithfully reproducing all the aspects that have made Saito's manga popular. Golgo 13's effectiveness, ethics, and ways with women (which could rival that of James Bond) are brought to life in vivid (and sometimes lurid) animation.\nNOTE: Orignally released in the US by Streamline Pictures, the rights have been acquired from the defunct company by Urban Vision, who has since re-released it.", "Before I even knew what Japanese animation was, I knew of Golgo 13... not the anime, and not the manga, but the 1988 \n game, Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode for the original \n home console, the Nintendo Entertainment System. Ah, memories. And now, seventeen years later, I've finally watched The Professional: Golgo 13... and I thought the game was mature! This has more violence that \n, and more sex than... well, no, hentai titles do have more sex... but still, this guy gets laid more than James Bond! At what's even worse is that he acts like he doesn't eve care. I mean, come on dude! Seriously, loosen up! Show the women some emotion here! But I digress.\n\nOkay, now when you're watching the opening credits, you have to keep in mind that this was made in 1983. Why? Because they use the latest in 1983 3-D technology! Wow. It kind looks like what the 3-D animators use today... when they're creating a mock-up of what they'll eventually be creating. Seriously, junior-high students can now make better 3-D just fooling around in their spare time after school. Then this awesome 1983 3-D animation also actually shows up in the film itself, towards the end. And just... wow. Seems like it would have been easier, cheaper, and better looking just to draw the scene by hand. But hey, back then it was awesome! But I digress... again.\n\nAlright, alright, on with the story! We first meet Duke Togo, codenamed Golgo 13, on a job. His job? Assassin! He pulls the trigger, and next thing you know his target happens to have an extra hole in the head. Then we jump right into his next job. Again, it's the same deal. Target sighted, trigger pulled, bullet enters head. And wouldn't you know it, but it all takes during a ceremony, right in front of the guy's wife, daughter, and most important of all, his father. It was Leonard \"Petroleum King\" Dawson's 62nd birthday, and just as he was about to hand the Dawson Corporation over to his son, Robert Frederick Dawson, Golgo's bullet it's mark. What timing! Now Leonard's on a non-stop mission of revenge to take out the man who killed his son!\n\nOf course, Mr. Togo still has jobs to do! He can't stop just because some rich and powerful guy has enlisted every resource at his disposal to kill the assassin. And by every resource, I'm talking FBI, CIA, US Military, and any other hand willing to pull a trigger. But there's not time for Mr. Togo to think about all that, he has to get on to finding and killing Dr. Z, head of a Mafia that killed some guy's entire family. And since nobody seems to know who this guy is or what he looks like, that's gonna be difficult. The best lead he has to go on is Cindy, Dr. Z's only daughter, who lives in a castle-like mansion with the tightest security available. And not to ruin it or anything, but yeah, Golgo sleeps with the girl, takes out his target, and moves on to his next job.\n\nGolgo continues with his jobs, but Dawson's constant attacks begin to take out every ally Golgo has. Finally our little assassin has to give in and go after Dawson to finish it once and for all. I know, it sucks to take a job that doesn't pay, but sometimes you just gotta do it. Of course, Dawson's obsession with the man that killed his son just begs the question, why isn't he going after the person that hired the assassin? For the assassin it was just another job, but for the person who hired him it was personal. Anyway, with creepy villains galore all trying to take down our persistent hitman, this battle is going to get worse before it gets better. But if you can make it to the end, then all will be revealed." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1983" ], "creator" : [ "Takao Saito" ], "company" : [ "Saito Prod." ], "director" : [ "Osamu Dezaki" ], "released" : [ "1 Movie" ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Hentai" ] } }

It was produced and created by Tatsuo Yoshida and released worldwide in 19671968 through Trans Lux who was also responsible for \n. It was first shown on Melbourne TV in December 1969 on channel 2 at 5:05pm weekdays.\nA total of 52 episodes were made. Peter Fernandez (other work includes The Space Giants, Ultraman, and \n [\n] as well as most of the Godzilla films) coordinated the English version and was the voice of \n and \n as well as Piper and Dr. Mariner from \n and a number of other characters. Corinne Orr (female) was the voice of \n, Mom Racer and Spritle after her success as the voice of \n. Jack Curtis was Pops Racer and Inspector Detector, after playing Bulton in \n. Jack Grimes was the voice of Sparky and Chim-Chim as well as Professor Fumble and Splasher in \n. The worldwide rights to the series are held by the Rocknowski family of Santa Monica, CA in the US (production info from Andy Shepherd)\nSpeed Racer was the story of \n, an 18 year old racing driver and his adventures on and off the track. On his helmet was printed M, originally standing for \"Go Mifune\" his original Japanese name. His girlfriend was \n, his younger brother Spritle, and Spritle's pet monkey was named Chim Chim. \n's mechanic and best friend was Sparky. \n's older brother was \n, who also played \n- a masked racer with even \n not knowing his real identity, and was an undercover agent. He had left home years ago and none of his family had seen him since.\n's car was known as the Mach 5. It was designed and built by his father \"Pops\" and was equipped with incredible features, operated by 7 buttons on the steering wheel.\nCarloco (Stallone and Shwartzenegger) purchased the rights to do a live action Speed Racer. They paid $10 million for the rights. The script was finished and even hired a casting agency and cast the parts. After the failure of Cliffhanger and Last Action hero, nothing became of it and so their licenses have expired. Too bad. I would have enjoyed it (from Dave Stenberg).\nA new series titled \"New series of Speed Racer\" was produced by Fred Wolf films from Teenage Mutant Turtle fame and released in 1993, but was not as popular as the original, for a few reasons. The animation was done by American cartoonists, losing that great Manga effect; the storyline and animation seems only to appeal to small children and not to adults as the original one did.

This time around, our perverted professor is a guy named Tomoya. We first see him in a classroom having fun with two female students, inter-cut with some scene taking place in a bar where he's talking to Ishiguro, a new student teacher that happens to look exactly like Tomoya, and have his same last name. This is where we see Tomoya drug Ishiguro so that he can impersonate him at the College of Sacred Maidens, where Ishiguro was supposed to start the very next day.\n\nApparently Tomoya's very good at turning sexy young women into his sexual servants, because he's only there for two weeks yet seems have two sex slave students as soon as he starts out. He decides that his third servant will be Yumi Kurichi, who is the younger sister of Karishima, another teacher at the school. Saejima, the gym teacher, is Karishima's boyfriend, but he can't seem to keep his hands of her sister, which gives Tomoya what he needs to make Yumi his. All he has to do is wait for Saejima to make his move, which doesn't take long. Then to the rescue he comes! Yumi is so grateful, that she even gives herself up willingly... well, mostly.\n\nNext on the list is Seira, the swim team captain. She had seen him come to the girls swimming pool, and thought he was a total pervert. Actually, she didn't just think it, she flat out told him so, which pretty much sealed her fate. And Tomoya already had what he needed to make her his pet. Earlier, he had overheard that she takes \"herbs\", which were, unbeknownst to her, illegal drugs. Unfortunately, when he reveals to her what she knows, she decides she'd rather go to the police than be blackmailed by a pervert. Needless to say, this infuriates Tomoya, and he takes Seira anyway.\n\nNext up is Asuka, track start turned lead actress in the theater club's show. Something happened between her and Miki Tachibana, which caused Miki to lose the role of lead actress. Whatever it was, it was apparently Asuka's fault. Jealous that Asuka took her place, Miki pretends to have forgiven Asuka, but secretly stashes some stolen tickets inside Asuka's pocket so the lovely young lass would get blamed for the theft. Of course, the devious Tomoya sees this, and decides to raises the sakes by adding about $1000 in cash to the pocket. Then, after the rehearsal, Tomoya calls Asuka into his now vacant classroom, and has her reveal the bulge in her pocket. We all know what happens next.\nAnd then we move on to the second episode, where the honorable Mr. Tomoya has his way more of the girls, including Miki and Satsuki. There really isn't any kind of story in either episode, just various reasons contrived for the sole purpose of having Tomoya molest the women of the campus... as if Tomoya needed any reasons? I can just picture him saying \"Oh, look, your shoelace is untied, guess I better rape you now\". Compared to the first title, the art style is similar, the sex is about the same, but the story of the original is just way better (because there actually is one)." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Around 2002–2003" ], "title" : [ "Tokubetsu Jyugyou 2" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Asuka Minamoto" }, { "name" : "Satsuki Kirishima" }, { "name" : "Madoka" }, { "name" : "Seira Himeno" }, { "name" : "Miki Tachibana" }, { "name" : "Tomoya Ishiguro" }, { "name" : "Samejima" }, { "name" : "Yumi Kirishima" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

Their days were easy and carefree... and then one fateful season all the humans just left. Although the raccoons didn't know quite what to make of it, they eventually settled into the fact that they had all the land to themselves. At first it was actually kind of nice, as they got to move in to the comfy old houses that were no longer occupied. Ah, but soon they realized exactly what was happening... it all became clear on that day in which the humans' giant machines started tearing down the old houses and tearing up the forest.\n\nThe humans were starting to develop the land, destroying the raccoons' forest home, transforming the once quaint rural area into suburbs for which many more humans would occupy. As the land shrank and food became more scarce, the raccoons began to fight amongst themselves... but eventually, thanks to a wise old raccoon, they realized that if they continued in this manner, they would wipe themselves out. The raccoons knew that something had to be done to stop the humans' development, not just to protect their homes, but to ensure their survival. And so they held a meeting, and together with the village elders they came up with a five year plan to stop the humans from destroying their habitat.\n\nThe meat of their plan involved resurrecting their ancient technique of transformation, in which the raccoons can morph themselves into anything they wish, pots, trees, foxes, and even humans. They figured that by mastering this technique, they could easily convince the humans to move on to other places. And so the elders began the hard task of training all the raccoons in this art form. It soon became clear, however, that not every raccoon could learn this technique, and not everyone who could learn it could do it well. But there were those who did, and they practiced hard, fueled by the determination that they would be able to help save their home as well as future generations. However, the humans' development moved faster than expected, and so after only a year, they raccoons had little choice but to start taking action.\n\nAnd so they began. It was a dark and stormy night, and they used it to their advantage, by transforming into things such as a falling trees and false roads which caused the truck drivers to wreck their vehicles. Several humans were killed, but to the raccoons it was a glorious success which warranted a celebration, because raccoons love to celebrate! But the tragedies only barely slowed down construction of the suburbs. And so, not wanting to hurt any more of the humans, the raccoons turned instead to playing pranks in order to scare them into thinking that the spirits were against the development of their land. But no matter how many people the raccoon scared off, more were trucked in.\n\nLeft with little choice, the raccoons had to go and seek out help from the ancient transformation masters, and so they sent two of their most adept shape-changers to find these masters and bring them back to the village. It will take a lot of endurance and more than a little luck to locate the masters in time, and even if they do, will it be enough to save the forest from the overbearing and determined humans? I know, I know, this sounds like some kind of heavy drama, but believe me, there really is a lot of comedy in here as well. I mean, just think about it, raccoons morphing into pots, ghosts, and even humans... how is that NOT funny, especially when the strain of holding the shape begins to take its toll and you see them start to revert to the normal shape.\n\nYeah, this film does have serious overtones, but it also has a lot of comedic characters and silly situations. For instance, when one of the major raccoon players was extremely upset and spouting on and on about how all humans need to be destroyed, all of them, no matter what, he soon becomes distracted by the thought of tempura and other human foods, causing him to recant his statement because he misses the food so much. Or during another part of the film when some raccoons user their transformation technique to enlarge their testicles to enormous proportions in order to squish people with them. Hmm, I think now would be a good time to tell a bit about the folklore that's used heavily in this film.\n\nFirst off, the raccoons... well, they're not actually raccoons. They're really a creature called a tanuki (タヌキ) that's native to Japan and is very similar in many ways to raccoons. In Japanese lore, tanuki have two distinctive features, the first being the magical ability to shape-shift. There are many Japanese stories about tanukis transforming into all sorts of different things, like tea kettles, tree branches, or even monks. The second distinctive feature are their very large testicles, which in the US dub are called \"pouches\". You can see this in many of the tanuki statues, and even more so in character art where they will even have their scrotum flung over their shoulder like a pack or bang on them like they would their belly.\nThe Disney release of this DVD was done pretty well, as one would expect, except for one thing... the second disc is completely worthless. The first disc contains the movie, with both a well done English dialog track and a Japanese dialog track with English subtitles. The second disc contains \"all\" the bonus features, which are Original Storyboards, TV Spots, and Trailers. Yep, that's it. A whole entire second disc just for that. Where's the making of featurette people? I mean, they didn't even include anything on Japanese folklore! What's the point of including this second disc and driving the price up for no reason?!

As a result, the episode was removed from both Japanese and (later) American broadcasts. Now, in 1998, the same show that took Japan by storm (in more ways than one) has arrived in the United States at the same time as the game upon which the show is based.\nPokémon, short for Pocket Monster, is the story of young \n and his quest to become a Pokémon master. Particularly, he wants to become a better trainer than his archrival: \n. To do that, he must travel the world in search of over 150 known species of Pokémon: creatures of varying shapes, sizes, colors, and abilities. He soon finds companions to travel with him, and also traveling with him is his first Pokémon: \n, an electric mouse Pokémon with a number of surprises. In his path are his own inexperience and the efforts of the infamous Team Rocket [j]Rocket Gundan (\n and \n), who steal rare Pokémon and who have their collective eyes on \n's \n in particular.\nIt is an exciting adventure combined with trying moments, lots of Pokémon combat, and plenty of laughs (such as the fact that all the Pokémon nurses look exactly the same, like they're all part of a big family). And better yet, with the games, you can try to become a Pokémon trainer yourself. Both the show and the game are simply fun.\nHere's a list of all the seasons:", "This third season of Pokemon starts out when \n tells \n to take the GS ball to Kurt, who lives in Azalea town in the Johto area. \n, \n, and \n go to the Jhoto area. The season goes up to when \n gets to Goldenrod city to get his third badge. Also, there are many new Pokemon that they see, Noctowl, for example.\nIf you have seen the episodes where \n has been able to capture Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle, \n captures these three-starter Pokemon in Jhoto. \n also says goodbye to two of them, one at the Charicific Valley, a valley that only has charizards, the other reunited with its old gang called the squirtle squad.\nTeam Rocket is after \n, and one episode I like is when \n, \n, and \n has this exchanger that gave both trainers empty pokeballs. Unfortunately, \n's Lickitung accidentally got put in a real exchanger, and she gets a Wobbufett. The episode is called \n.\nAlso, there is a rich lady that owns a Snubbull that likes to bite \n's tail, and is shown in other episodes looking for that tail to bite. The episode called,\n has it biting \n's tail while \n is disguised as a Sunflora." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "April 1997-present" ], "creator" : [ "Satoshi Tajiri; Game Freak" ], "company" : [

It was released in Japan in 1965-1966 and aired in Melbourne in March 1967 on channel 9 at 5:00pm weekdays. It's been said that it last appeared on TV in March 1972 on Daryl Somers' Cartoon Corner, but I've received some reports that it had aired after that. According Brad, he watched it as a kid between May and July 1975. And according to both Leo and Rich, it was on WSNS Channel 44 Chicago around 1975-1976, after which it was replaced with \n.\nIt was described in the TV Week as \"New US comic series.\" The English version was produced by James Nicholson and Samuel Z Arkoff at the famous B grade studios of American International Television Productions. Other works of Arkoff include Amityville Horror (1979), Blacula (1972), as well as a number of monster type movies. A total of 52 episodes were released, but none of them was given an English Episode title. Reuben Guberman (\n and \n) wrote 48 of the episodes and his sister Rose wrote the other four. Reuben died on March 19th, 2000. A great loss but his life will live on through his work.\nThe production info was thought to be lost to history but \n has finally uncovered it.\nThe series begins with the Galactic Union of Worlds at a meeting on the planet named Radion where Prince Planet lives. The chief asks the question \"Shall we contact Earth and offer them membership?\" A delegate of beings from a number of worlds (including Mars) oppose the membership, describing humans as arrogant, funny-looking, war mongers that are not advanced enough...but nevertheless they are given a chance. Prince Planet is a Universal Peace Corps member who is chosen from hundreds of volunteers to be sent to Earth to bring law and order and a love of peace to Earth so they can become part of the Galactic Union. His assignment: \"To fight evil and cruelty whenever and wherever it affects the planet Earth.\" Prince Planet has an IQ of 300 compared with Earth standards. He has been given a concentrated, scientific and moral education by electroinductive hypnotraining and is classed as a genius. Through the pendant he is given the ability to change into a normal boy and when found on Earth by a girl named Diana Worthy, he is given the name Bobby and lives on a ranch with Diana and her father Pops Worthy. Diana wears a ring which can signal Prince Planet when she is in danger. The main city is Metropol.\nPrince Planet's pendant receives power (energy) from a nuclear energy center (energy transmitter) on Radion. When Bobby changes to Prince Planet he calls out Peeeeee Pazow! The operators at the centre often forget to charge up his pendant, usually when he is in a fight with an enemy and about to die. But of course the operators remember in the nick of time. Without energy he becomes very weak. The pendant has many uses such as a converter, weapon, transforming to Bobby and back to Prince Planet, for flying, strength, as a torch etc. In many episodes Bobby looks up at the stars at night and gets homesick for his mom on Radion. He realises that when he was given the ability to live as a normal boy on Earth he also had to accept the emotions and desires of a normal boy, including homesickness.\nIn the last episode, Prince Planet has been on Earth for a year and is called back to Radion to make his report to the Council of the Worlds on a special rocket ship sent for him. On his journey back home he remembers about his adventures on Earth and thinks about his friends and enemies that he fought throughout the series. He must now convince the Council of the Galactic Union that the Earth is worthy of membership. He reports that good people far outnumber the evil and beauty is much easier to find than ugliness, but whatever happens the Earth is better for his having been there. The closing words of the series: \"Goodbye and thank you Prince Planet.\" With all Prince Planet's enemies destroyed and friends gone their separate ways, it was doubtful that another series would be made.

She would always go out of her way to help students, even if it meant endangering her own life, but apparently the results were worth the risk, as she seemed to have a profound effect upon everyone she helped. And then one night she was dead. It appeared as if she had fell off the roof of a school building, so the police brushed it off as an accident. But this was no accident, Professor Yuko was pushed... murdered! Everyone was sadened by the loss, not to mention confused, angered, and even outraged, but four of her male students in particular decide to take this murder mystery into their own hands. This new-found detective squad consists of Masayoshi, Daisuke, Mitsuru, and Shinya, and together they become bound and determined to track down whoever it was that executed this awful deed against Professor Yuko, and then punish them severly.\n\nTheir first clue comes from a page in Professor Yuko's schedule book. In the slot dated the night of her murder, there was an note that read \"matters on the roof\". Then, on the adjacent page, the names of several girls were jotted down. The first is Sae Ichijyo, who is the top athlete on the swim team. Next is Nami Sudou, who has a reputation for being quite promiscus. Then Hikaru Nagihara, another member of the swim team, but rumored to not know how to swim. After that comes Kiyoka Enjyoji, who is super rich, and Shiori Sakura, who is the school chancellor's daughter. And finally, Nozomi Itou, who is bascially Shiori's shadow, following everywhere she goes. Was Professor Yuko supposed to have a meeting with these girls on the roof the night she was murdered? Looks like it's time to investigate!\n\nSo first off, the guys place hidden video cameras all around the school. They used to do this to secretly record people having sex, until they all made a promise to Professor Yuko that they would never again do such a thing. But now they're doing it not for personal pleasure, but find out who killed the professor, and why. The first video they review was taken from the hidden camera in the swim team coach's office, in which they discover the coach having sex with Hikaru. A short conversation between the two gives the guys get a small clue in their investigation. Next they move on more footage, this time of Nami getting it on with four unknown guys, and loving every minute of it. I guess she lives up to her reputation! A short conversation between them provides another clue. Now the guys feel like they have enough to start dishing out punishments, starting with Sae Ichijyo and Kiyoka Enjyoji.\n\nBefore that takes place, however, Nozomi Itou is attacked by an unseen group of guys, apparently because she was about to reveal something she wasn't supposed to. They have their way with her, ensuring that she won't feel any more desire to speak up. Eventually Masayoshi and Daisuke find their way to Sae Ichijyo. During their confrontation, Daisuke has her change out of her swimsuit and into a pink nurses uniform, where he then makes her pose for pictures. Masayoshi can only take so much of his fooling around before he takes Sae into one of the bathroom stalls to deliver his punishment. Afterwards, it's time for Masayoshi and Mitsura to confront Kiyoka at her estate. There, they make her stip off her uniform, revealing a kinky revealing under-outfit that she had been secretly wearing all day. And once again, Masayoshi quickly dishes out his form of punishment.\n\nWell, needless to say more action ensues as the guys continue their investigation, though things get really confusing once they discover the truth. Honesly, I didn't know what to make of it. The conclusion didn't seem to make any sense at all, and then there was some lesbian affair thing that was mentioned which never seemed to go anywhere, so I don't know what the point of that was either. Storywise, it held my interest up until the end, at which point I became baffeled. As for the production values, the acting and sound effects were all about average, and the art and animation were all on par with the typical \n releases, which is good, better than many, but nothing fantastic." ], "jp_info" : { "title" : [ "Sei Sai", "Sex Judge" ], "company" : [ "Blue Gate" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Coach" }, { "name" : "Nami Sudou" }, { "name" : "Daisuke" }, { "name" : "Nozomi Itou" }, { "name" : "Hikaru Nagihara" }, { "name" : "Professor Yuko" }, { "name" : "Kizuna Negishi" }, { "name" : "Sae Ichijyo" }, { "name" : "Masayoshi Negishi" }, { "name" : "Shinya" }, { "name" : "Mitsura Samejima" }, { "name" : "Shiori Sakura" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

Thing is, you're really gonna have to use your imagination on that one because this whole movie focuses on the completion of an artificial island project by the end of the century. Oh, and by the way, those giant robot vehicles are called \"Labors\".\n\nOkay, so the stage is set! The Labors are working hard to get this thing done in time, and to help them out a new operating system called HOS was just released two months ago which served to increase efficiency by something like 30%. The thing is... in the last two months, there have also been a number of Labors that just went haywire. Completely unresponsive to operator control, these rogue Labors would just up and start rampaging until a Patlabor could be sent to take them down. To Azuma, member of the Labor Police- Special Vehicle Division, this is more than just coincidence!\n\nSo Azuma sets out on an investigation to discover whether or not this new HOS operating system has anything to do with the berserk Labors. His investigation leads him to conclude there is almost definitely a connection, and that his immediate superiors suspected as much... but is it an accidental bug, or something much more sinister? Time to pick up the pace, Azuma, 'cause that little fact you learned about what the trigger is that makes those things go haywire... well, there's another one coming real soon, and this one is big... big enough to cause over 8,000 Labors to freak out simultaneously!\n\nThis film was made in the late 80's, and visually it sure feels like it. The art and animation is definitly good enough for a movie, but just doesn't stand up to such other films as Akira and Ghost in the Shell. That being said, the backgrounds and the angles that were chosen really does lead one to seriously get a feel for the atmoshpere of their city. And the story, it was much deeper than I expected, and yet at the same time not so deep that it became confusing and we're left wondering what the heck is going on. Although there are giant robots everywhere, this film feels much more like a police investigation flick rather than some kind of robot grudge match.\n\nThe \n is being released on April 25, 2006, and features an all new English translation and dubbing. It also features a newly remastered anamorphic transfer and new authentic 5.1 channel sound. Wow... kinda wish I knew what that meant. Oh yeah, and it's also a two-disc set, where the second disc contains a load of extra features, such as an interview with the director (Mamoru Oshii), an interview with the screenwriter (Kazunori Ito), an interview with the mecha designer (Yutaka Izubuchi), an interview with the character designer (Akemi Takada), and an interview with the music composer (Kenji Kawai). These are all in Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, apparently this release, limited to 10,000 numbered sets, also includes not one, but two books filled with all sorts of good stuff. The first book, called \"Archives\" (184 pages), contains an exposition and criticism of the film (character, story background, artwork, etc.), interviews with all those important guys listed above, key animation drawing samples with explanatory notes, and then some other stuff. The second book, called \"Storyboard\" (300 pages), is by the director Mamoru Oshii, and I assume by the title is a storyboard of the film, though since I don't actually have the book I can't say for sure. Anyway, sure sounds like quite a release!

The pig's pet, a very cute young man, apologizes and invites the brothers in for tea.\nThe young man realizes \n wants to join the Shinsengumi and says he knows people there, and will put in a good word.

Also, in this film, Patlabors are a rare sight... which I find kind of weird seeing as how it's called \"Patlabor\". And you know what else seems to be missing from this film? Action. Yeah, this is definitely not an action flick. This is a movie for people who like to think. I've watched this twice now, and I'm still shaking on the plot details. It involves some kind of whole political conspiracy thing that I just don't get.\nSo the story basically starts off with a bay bridge being blown up. Apparently, it was due to a missile fired from a jet fighter, though from what I understood, the jet was on a routine training mission when the terrorist or whoever hacked into the system and fired the missile, so it wasn't the pilot. And thus the investigation begins! Who is this mysterious hacker and what's his game? In order to hack into those highly secured computers, he must be pretty dang good... and most likely an insider, someone who worked on systems.\n\nAh, but that's just the beginning. Now, remember that jet? Well, a shadowy image of that jet fighter that was coincidentally caught on videotape by a crew who was filming the bridge for some TV show... but then apparently this footage had then been altered to look like a different type of jet... because of some political reason or something. I'm not really sure.\nOkay, so basically the vibe I was getting was that these terrorists or whoever it is that was hacking into the defense department wanted to turn the government departments against each other in order to overthrow them... or something. Again, I'm not really sure. There's a whole lot of politics involved, and I've always been horrible with figuring that kind of stuff out. It's like chess, where they're always thinking several moves ahead, and I'm sitting here pretending like I see the whole plan but in reality am just thinking I really wish they were playing checkers so I could know who was wining.\n\nAnyway, so stepping outside the confusing plot (or confusing for me, at least), the visual style and atmosphere present are extremely well done. It feels so much more real than many live-action Hollywood movies. It doesn't seem like an anime world at all, but rather like you've been living there in Tokyo with these characters all along. Quite an accomplishment, I must say! The first movie accomplished much the same feel, though I think this one got it even better.\nStill, there is a lot of down time here, and I mean a LOT. Yes, the way each shot is set up makes the scenes more interesting that they would otherwise be, but... yeah... I just wish it would have been a bit more exciting, like edge-of-your-seat, what's-going-to-happen-next kind of tension, instead of making me do all this brain work attempting to figure out what's going on. Thankfully, the action does pick up again in the third act, like when the hellicopter starts blowing the crap out of everything! Anyway, if you're one of those individuals who loves these kind of thinking-man plots, then I'm sure you'll find this film a treat. Otherwise, if you're like me and love the action, you'll probably be disappointed.\n\nThe \n was released on July 11, 2006, and just like \n, it features an all new English translation and dubbing, a newly remastered anamorphic transfer, and new authentic 5.1 channel sound. Wow... still wish I knew what that meant. It's also a two-disc set, where the second disc contains a complete \"making of\", broken up into the following segments: Image, Location Hunting, Direction Plan, CG Works, Animation Works, Character Design Works, Mechanical Design Works, Shooting, Cast on Voice, and Special Talk (1994) Mamoru Oshii & Toshiya Ueno. These are all in Japanese with English subtitles.\nThe Special Collector's Edition also comes with two books, one called Patlabor 2 The Movie Archives, and the other called Patlabor 2 The Movie Storyboards by Mamoru Oshii. And I must say, both books are very impressive! The Storyboard book shows the storyboards for the entire film, with dialog and notes next to the sketches. And in the back it has a glossary of basic terms that are used, so you can understand their jargon. Then the Archives book is an in-depth look at the movie, with not only information and insights, but sketches, screenshots, photos of brochures, a map of Tokyo, and even actual photos of the city.

Both episodes are about a half hour in length, and yet for some reason (greed!) they are split up into completely separate DVD releases. Both episodes would easily fit onto a single DVD... a single, single-layer DVD, so splitting them up and charging $20 each is just criminal. Oh, and I hope you know beforehand which one of these volumes is episode one and which is episode two, because they sure don't tell you anywhere on the DVD packaging. I guess they expect you to be psychic or something.\nThen again, on the other hand, maybe they're trying to tell us that it doesn't matter which one we watch first because the story doesn't make much sense anyway. I've watched each one twice, in proper order, and I still don't really fully understand what's going on. The story starts at a school where a couple of school girls, brown-haired Akiko Akiko and blue-haired Erika, are taking a break from running track. Then their instructor comes by, and the girls say something about how big her breasts are, and then they all see something in the sky.\n\nAfter a big flash of light, Erika awakes on a cot in a windowless, stone room. Then two men dressed in military uniforms enter and say \"welcome to our country\"... alright, so the three women were transported to another country where luckily the people speak the same language. Well that's good at least. So the two men gag Erika and walk her down the hall where they pass by a room with an open door. Inside, Erika sees Akino being forcibly serviced by four other military guys. They continue on to another room where Erika's hands are bound to a chain hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the room, most of her clothes are removed, and she's told \"this is revenge\". So she's just as confused as we are.\n\nNext, her blindfolded instructor is brought in, and Erika is made to watch while they strip her and use her for their pleasure... though she seems to be enjoying it as well. It's not until they remove her blindfold and she sees her student watching her that she asks them to stop. Of course, that doesn't slow them down and the least, nor does it seem to stop her from enjoying it as Erika looks on with a face bright red from embarrassment. All the while, the guy keeps talking to Erika like she's supposed to understand what's going on, and talking about how there's a beast inside her.\n\nNext, we find her completely nude strapped to a table with the guy urging her to confess on join them. I'd like to take a moment here to point out that Erika has tan lines, which you really don't see all that often in hentai. And it's not a bikini tan line, as her skin tone is lighter in the areas that are usually covered by her track suit. Blah blah blah, I'm sure you can guess the basics of what happens next. After that's over, Erika has a flashback to a track race that she one and a romantic moment with her boyfriend.\n\nOkay, so here's where it really starts getting weird... back in her cell, she starts to hear a voice in her head that helps her to knockout one of guards who is currently preoccupied between her thighs. She then sees a monster who tore the other guards to pieces, and he helps her to escape. She passes out during the attempt, and after a very short dream about her and her brother when they were little kids, she awakes in a room, lying on a bed completely naked. A moment later, a guy enters who has the same bright red hair color as the monster that saved her.\nAnother sex scene ensues, though I'm sure you probably wouldn't have guessed it involves a tentacle monster! Anyway, afterwards storm clouds form in a circle in the sky above and lighting and thunder begin to rock the night... and then it's on to the next episode, \n!

However, due to a horrible incident, he put away the sword that kills and decided he would never kill another human being, no matter what. He took up a reverse-blade sword. This way, even though he used the impressive Hiten Mitsurugi style, he could protect others without killing.\nTen years after he starts wandering, he meets a girl named \n who mistakes him for a man who calls himself \"Battousai the Manslayer\" and is killing people in the name of the Kamiya Kasshin style. \n attacks \n, thinking he is this person, since he carries a sword. However, she quickly learns that he is not the one she is looking for.\nLater, she is fighting with the \"real\" Battousai, who injures her and is about to kill her when \n jumps in the way and quickly carries \n to safety. She lets him stay the night at her place, and he accepts. The next day, she is attacked again, when \n appears. He defeats the man and tells him the Battousai doesn't use the Kamiya Kasshin style, but he uses the Hiten Mitsurugi style. \n realizes that \n really is Battousai, but she tells him she doesn't care about his past. \n decides to stay at the Kamiya dojo. Later, a boy named \n comes to live with them, and they also meet new people such as the lady doctor \n, the freeloader \n, the brooding \n and high-spirited \n, and the merciless \n.\nRurouni Kenshin focuses on how \n affects other people's lives, and how they affect his. It also sends messages such as \"no matter how many sins you commit, you can still repent\".

Oh, and I doubt that it could just be an invisible place because I'm sure scientists would discover it just by the affect it's mass has on its surroundings.... Well, guess it doesn't really matter since this is a hentai title after all, and quite a soft-core one at that, at least compared to all the ones out today. It doesn't get nearly as graphic, but it's still enough to push it beyond just the \"Ecchi\" genre.\n\nOkay, so as I understand it, the sorrow that people feel from Earth is driving the moon further away, and the only way to bring it back is for Kaguya to go to Earth and combat this sorrow. This anime basically follows her on two of these missions to Earth, one per episode. For her first mission, she finds pathetic loser Tanaka trying to make the love of his life, Ikuko, happy on her birthday, though she harshly shuts him down and leaves him standing the flowers he bought thrown on the floor. So as poor Tanaka is feeling totally pathetic, we find that Ikuko is actually intimately involved with a female doctor named Manami! I totally didn't see that one coming.\n\nI also didn't see what was coming next... Manami is tired of Ikuko, and devises a plan to kill her! And that's not all, as she herself is also intimately involved with another individual, Dr. Okabe, a male doctor! Well, Kaguya takes poor pathetic Tanaka and shows him all this that is going on, and gives him the opportunity to prove his love to Ikuko, and to get revenge on the devious Manami... which ends up with Tanaka being turned into a girl! He then seduces Manami's boyfriends (*shiver*), and makes sure that Manami catches the two of them together in an intimate embrace... except when she does, Kaguya changes Tanaka back to a guy, sending Manami into complete shock and disbelief! Talk about hilarious!\n\nThe second story is also about a pathetic boy, Satoshi, but this time his girlfriend, Mika, is fed up with him because he always takes her on dates instead of having sex with her. She feels he's just never going gave enough confidence to take that step, and so she kicks him to the curb. Once Satoshi stumbles into Kaguya little fortune-teller tent and she is able recognize his problem, she attempts to help out by getting naked and making him touch her in order to help him get experience with a naked female body. Unfortunately, he can't quite handle it, and passes out.\n\nRealizing how much of a loser he is, his body later just seems to shut down while playing videogames, when actually his spirit became trapped in the game, so Kaguya and her man-servant Pipi have to go in and rescue him! Kaguya is quickly captured and molested by the main boss, a mutated version of Satoshi. Luckily Pipi comes to the rescue, and once Satoshi is free, Kaguya is able to discover the true reason behind his issues... his mother leaving him at a young age. Armed with this knowledge, Kaguya is able to devise another tactic for getting Satoshi to overcome his intimacy issues... first allowing him to suckle at her breasts like a baby, and then turning him into steam so that he can be with and touch Mika while she takes a bath.

It is a mix of fact and fiction, taking real people and events from mid-1700s France (before and during the French Revolution) and mixing in fiction to spin an emotionally interesting yarn... kinda like what James Cameron did with Titanic. I often found myself wondering what was fact and what was fiction and making mental notes to go online and find out. Guess that's a good way to make history interesting!\nThe main character of the story is Oscar Francois de Jarjays, a woman who was raised as a man by her father, General François Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes. Her father had been wanting a son, but when his 6th child was also born a girl something snapped and he decided to name her Oscar and raise her as a man. In most anime I'd expect this to be kept secret and have situations and plot points build around covering up the deception, but here it was made no secret. Everyone who knows Oscar knows she's a woman, and those who don't know her and are soon told if they accidentally refer to her as male.\nAs I mentioned earlier, historical France is the main setting of this story, which is another nice change from typical anime. Early on, Oscar becomes commander of the Royal Guard which leads her to take care of the safety of Marie Antoinette and the rest of the royal family. We get to see Marie Antoinette as a 14 year old girl when she becomes engaged to the crown prince Louis XVI and we're with her as she grows up, gets married, and becomes queen. As a princess, we get to witness her rivalry with the King's mistress, Madame du Barry, which is tense and kept me wanting to see the next episode to see what would happen.\nThen when she becomes queen, du Barry vanishes from the picture and new characters enter and we see the tragic life of this character. It's an interesting journey, but the focus isn't always on Marie Antoinette. For instance, there is a pair of sisters, Rosalie Lamorlière and Jeanne Valois de la Motte, who have opposite personalities and end up separating, with Rosalie becoming the protégé of Oscar to learn all she can in order to take revenge on the noble woman that killer her mother, and Jeanne scheming and scamming her way into nobility. There are tragic circumstances all around and it's just so soap-opera-like that you don't want to stop watching.\nThe artwork has kind of a classic feel to it, which makes sense seeing as how it was made in 1979. I think this just adds to its charm. I'd definitely recommend any anime fan check this out. On May 7, 2013 The Right Stuf released all 40 episodes in two box sets so it's now readily available. It's Japanese dialog only as they didn't dub it into English, but personally I couldn't imagine it any other way.

Unfortunately, the business arrangement between Joe Oriolo and his then partner, Burt Hecht, fell apart, and as part of the settlement, the Hecht departed with the \"Princess Knight\" masters never to be heard from again. For over 20 years anime historians were unable to confirm whether Hecht or subsequent owners of the property ever got it into any of the U.S. markets. This is why most people have never seen it, or know of its existence.\nThe series, however, was marketed to other English speaking countries where it ran in syndication for years as it did in Australia beginning in November of 1972 at 4:30pm on channel 7.\n\nIt has been recently established that Princess Knight did indeed play in select U.S. markets in the 1970s. It showed up in Hawaii in the early 1970s, in Texas in the mid 1970s, and the Minneapolis/St.Paul area first in 1978 and again in 1982-1983 on KSTP-TV, Channel 5. Other information that it may have run on Nickelodeon many years back as a part of a retro/nostalgia marathon, but this has yet to be confirmed.\nAn interesting note: Before the split between Joe Oriolo and Bert Hecht, Joe's son, Don Oriolo, and a fellow named Roger Grod, managed to edit several of the episodes together for a theatrical release, giving it the title \"Choppy and the Princess\". Don managed to get it into a few cinemas, but it didn't do too well. It also had a weak video release. We also know that it was released on home video in both the U.K. and in Australia in the early 90's.\nIn 1996, the Princess Knight masters minus the opening and closing credits turn up in the hands of some company in the Netherlands. Streamline Pictures in California got the masters and was busy negotiating with Orion for the distribution when the deal fell through. Orion was in financial trouble at the time and has since been bought-out by MGM. Now, MGM holds the \"Prince Planet\" and \"Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot\" masters which had been in the Orion library. As for Princess Knight, the masters are back with the folks in The Netherlands and Shawne Kleckner at \n (a company committed to rescuing classic anime from oblivion) is trying to negotiate for the series release.\nAnother interesting note: In 1967, Oriolo's only other attempt at the anime market in the U.S. was a series christened \"Johnny Cypher in Dimension Zero\" to be released and distributed through Seven Arts. Again, episodes were licensed, scripted and dubbed, but before it could be released Warner Brothers bought Seven Arts and squashed the release in the U.S. for unknown reasons. Don Oriolo gave me some vague explanation but it is still unclear why it was done. He still has all the masters in his archives but can't do a thing with them unless WB gives the OK and they obviously have no plans to do so. (Actually, several people saw this show broadcast in the U.S. More info can be found at the \n.)", "The king and the queen have a daughter, and the queen can't have more children. Since only a boy can be king, she is disguised and trained as such. Enemies in the court, such as Neelon, spy her every move, and there is a Duke that always caused problems as well. A little angel, Choppy, is her companion as she goes through a total of 54 (?) episodes, meeting such characters as a very mean and powerful sorcerer and his daughter, who becomes her best friend.\nIn the last episodes, her parents are killed by a powerful invader, and she has to retake the kingdom with the help of her few remaining friends, after which her parents are given back to her.\nI forgot to mention that she sometimes acts under the disguise of the Phantom Knight -- or something like that, I saw the series in French -- and the young prince of the neighboring kingdom marries (or gets engaged to) her when he finds out that she's a girl, therefore providing for a happy ending.\nAll in all, a wonderful series that I would LOVE to see on DVD someday.", "The story at the start shows babies in heaven ready to be given a heart, which will decide whether they will be male or female (pink for girl blue for boy). The angel kid was mischievous and changed the princess' heart from a blue one to a pink one, hence she is born a girl.\nThe angel was then sent to retrieve her soul and give her the right one. Also, as the story progresses the king is deposed (I am not sure why or how, I think it was a invasion) and the Queen and the princess are sent into prison. The Princess finds a way out of the prison and begins to fight for justice in the surrounding countryside (a la Robin Hood, Zorro) as the Phantom Knight.", "A message from Lazar West, who used to watch Princess Knight religiously on Sky-Channel in Switzerland, tells us that the basics of the show involved a princess who would dress up in disguise as a lad to fight bad guys, while trying to keep her identity a secret.\n\nAccording to a message from Reece, he lived in Hawaii during the early 70's, where they showed a lot of anime and live-action Japanese shows. Because of this, Reece has been able to confirm that Princess Knight also aired in Hawaii, on \n television, between Kikaida and Kamen Raida (two popular, live-action sci-fi Japanese shows). Someone else noted that they watched it in the early 1970s on \n, Honolulu as part of an afterschool children's show called \n.\nAn email from Al says that he can also verify that Princess Knight aired in the US, both in Hawaii (from 1970-73) and Sunday mornings in Texas (mid 1970's). Then Anthony says that he distinctly recalls watching it as early as the late 1970s and as late as 1983 to 1985 on \n. Dustin confirms that it was airing around 1982-1983 where he watched it early Saturday mornings in Minnesota (near Minneapolis).\nSome info sent by Adam sheds some new light on the story of Princess Knight. He says that her father is king of their country, and the law only allows men to take the throne.  The Queen either died or is unable to have more children, so they must hide the fact that she is a girl.  She had some sort of companion/guardian named Choppy (a little angel I think) to help keep her out of trouble." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "April 2, 1967–April 7, 1968" ], "creator" : [ "Kume Minoru, Tezuka Osamu" ], "company" : [ "Tezuka Prod.", "Mushi Production" ], "title" : [ "Ribon no Kishi" ], "director" : [ "Katsui Chikao, Akabori Kanji" ], "released" : [ "52 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Fantasy" ] } }

But Narumi has a plan to make things even better... at least, for herself. She has decided to open a new ward in a building disconnected from the hospital, a ward in which the nurses will cater to the patients' each and every desire... and I mean \n desire! But in order for this dream to come to fruition, she'll need nurses that are willing to take on these special tasks. Of course, those kind of nurses are definitely not easy to come by. So since \"Willing Sex Slave\" is not a part of the standard employment application, she decides to enlist an old acquaintance from 10 years ago to help her out, a one Dr. Ryuji Hirasaka.\n\nDr. Hirasaka is a gynecologist, but hasn't been practicing in 10 years, so when he receives an offer for a month-long contract at the hospital, he doesn't ask any questions. We're not sure why he hasn't worked for so long, but were given glimpses into some kind of \"experiment\" he was supposedly doing at the hospital with a busty, naked, green-haired woman. Anyway, as he arrives, he spies a young nurse outside picking flowers. His imagination begins to run wild with fantasies, until she snaps him out of it by speaking to him. It turns out she works in the gynecology department... lucky him!\n\nSoon afterward, Dr. Hirasaka heads up to meet his boss. As he enters the chief's office, he is shocked and speechless to see Ms. Jinguji sitting in the big chair behind the desk. His thoughts immediately turn to the conclusion that she must have called him here to take revenge, but she soon calms the panicked fellow. As she reveals her plan for the ultimate sex ward, he begins to understand why she called him. He has a talent that not very many people have, which is being able to turning innocent young girls into willing sex slaves! Eagerly, Dr. Hirasaka agrees to participate in her scheme, but says he needs a contract. Not willing to put anything in writing which would leave a paper trail, Narumi seals the deal with an \"oral\" agreement, if you know what I mean. And if you don't know what I mean, then you probably shouldn't be reading this!\n\nThe first assignment Narumi gives Dr. Hirasaka just happens to be the young nurse he met earlier. He finally locates her in a patient's room, where he sees her talking to the muscular young man in way more fitting a girlfriend than a nurse. But it's when he sees them kiss that he becomes enraged with jealousy, and even more determined to make her his sex slave. When she is then called to the front to meet with some visitors, he follows, and discovers that she's paying these tough looking fellows to keep quiet about an incident which would disgrace her patient, who's apparently a famous young boxer.\n\nThis is exactly what the doctor needs to blackmail the young nurse. So before she heads home for the night, our good doctor calls her into his office for a little chat, which quickly turns into an uninvited grope session. Hirasaka reveals to her what he knows as she continues to struggle free, and when she pleads with him not to tell anybody, he stops for a moment, and agrees. We get to see her eyes light up and a smile cross her face for the first since she entered the room, at least until his hands begin wandering again. C'mon girl, how could you have not seen that coming?! You seriously think he would bring you into his office, feel you up, then agree to keep your secret and let you leave?\n\nWell, it's not long before sex slave number one has started her \"training\" that Narumi provides Dr. Hirasaka with his second assignment, a young nurse (aren't they all?) involved in some kind of mistake that caused a patient to end up in the ICU (that's short for Intensive Care Unit, where you go when you're really bad off). And if that wasn't bad enough, the patient eventually died. Thus once again the good doctor has the blackmail he needs to make distraught young woman into a nice little sex slave. Her initiation goes pretty much the same way as the previous one, with a little variation in the sex and the props involved. And wouldn't ya know it, but so far both girls have been virgins.\n\nThe problem comes the day after, when she runs into him outside on the hospital grounds. She reveals to him that she's decided to go and tell the police everything, her involvement with patient's accident and Dr. Hirasaka's assault. That's when he pulls a little digital video cassette from his pocket, explaining that if he had their entire experience on the little tape, and had no problem making it public if she talked. So what does she have to do to get the tape back, you ask? Yeah... you know... yeah. And if you don't know, then go away, 'cause you shouldn't be reading this! So Dr. Hirasaka figures why wait, and pulls her through some bushes where they immediately start going at it. Surprisingly enough, when he finishes he actually gives her the tape. Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all... oh wait, you mean that tape was just a copy? Yeah, he's still such a bad guy.\n\nFor the doctor's third assignment, things get a little trickier. With nothing on her to blackmail, the doctor has to set her up and \n something to blackmail her on. It takes some ingenuity on his part, but of course he succeeds, and once we get past that, it's back to the same method of training for the young lass. Then, just when you're ready see what's going to happen to these nurses now that they're \"trained\", the anime ends. Just like that. Yep, I trained me some nurses, the end. In order to find out what happens with the young ladies, what Narumi's real intentions are, and what happens with the creation of the sex ward, you'll need to pick up the sequel... or at least I would hope so, because it's obviously frustrating when something you're watching just ends without closer." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2000" ], "title" : [ "Yakin Byoutou" ], "company" : [ "Discovery", "AT-2 Project" ], "director" : [ "Nao Okezawa" ], "released" : [ "3 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Ako Fujisawa" }, { "name" : "Naoya Ohkawa" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Narumi Jinguji" }, { "name" : "Dr. Ryuji Hirasaka" }, { "name" : "Remi Shinjyo" }, { "name" : "Karumi Jinguji" }, { "name" : "Ren Nanase" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

The colonies are inhabited by scientists and workers. To control the colonies, the major nations ally together and call themselves \"The Allied Nations of the Earth Sphere Alliance\" (the area containing the Earth and the colonies is called the Earth Sphere). Their rule started out peaceful enough, but later on they abused their power and started a tyrannical reign of terror using their military weapons, called mobile suits. Mobile suits are huge robotic suits that are piloted by men and women of the Earth Sphere Alliance military. The mobile suits use fear, instead of peace, to control the colonies.\nThe year is After Colony (A.C.) 195. The colonies of the Earth Sphere are under the complete control of the Alliance. But, certain scientists of the colonies are dissatisfied with the way the colonies are treated. So they decided to create special mobile suits, made out of almost indestructable gundanium, which can only be made in zero gravity. They call these mobile suits \"Gundams\", which can only be piloted by the best.

Anyway, now the masterless roaming swordsman is back, and this time he finds himself in his very own TV series. Hard to imagine, but it's true, and what's more amazing is that the television series retains a lot of the adult material found in the movie, such as creepy monsters, fountains of blood, and naked flesh. I doubt you'll be seeing this on US television anytime soon, but thanks to Urban Vision you can catch this action-packed series on DVD, and this way you get it uncut, and with both an English and Japanese language track.\n\nAll poor Jubei wants is to get a good nights rest. Is that really too much to ask? Well, according to the creatures battling it out over yonder, yes, yes it is. So Jubei heads on over to politely ask the warring parties to either keep it down or take their battle elsewhere, to which the fighters gladly comply... yeah, as if. But don't worry your pretty little head about Jubei, 'cause that guys knows how to take care of himself. With one swipe of his blade, Jubei splits one of the baddies straight in half, which causes another one to flee. The only remaining warrior, a strong, masked, werewolf-like creature named Roga, attempts to hire Jubei on as a bodyguard, but Jubei refuses, saying that he doesn't trust anyone who hides their face.\n\nThe next day we meet Shigure, a woman with some serious fighting skills whose trying to train the rest of her village to become great fighters... and things don't seem to be going to well. What she wouldn't give for at least one person to finally beat her in a match! Then she hears one of her homemade alarms go off, signaling that an intruder is entering their village. She rushes to the scene in a heartbeat, only to see our Jubei easily catching and defecting the arrows shot out by her booby trap. Amazed at his talent, the villagers allows Jubei to stay for a while and rest... but of course as soon as he does trouble comes about. Can we cut this guy a break people?!\n\nIt seems the female baddie that escaped the fray last night has enlisted the help of some kind of giant cyclops creature to help in obtaining the sacred Dragon Stone, a small pendent like item. The villagers immediately rip off their work clothes to reveal karate outfits underneath and start flicking ninja stars at the giant beast like it was second nature... seems like somebody's been holding something back from Shigure! While the cyclops monster takes out the village, Jubei takes on the evil female baddie from last night, and the werewolf warrior takes off after Shigure. He catches up quick, though we then see he's there to protect her. Unfortunately, he becomes fatally injured in the process.\n\nAfter Jubei finally slices his foe in two, he comes across Roga, who hands him the Dragon Stone and asks him to deliver it to the Maiden of Light... aka Shigure! Jubei makes a promise that he will, and sets off after her, Shigure... the Light Maiden, and the last survivor of her village... but really, doesn't it seem like that's always the case? Anyway, on his journey to find her, he instead comes across some kind of cat woman who is just bound and determined to take the Dragon Stone... and she has friends. Meanwhile, Shigure is fleeing for her life from that giant cyclops creature from the other night... and fleeing along with her are two guys she had just recently met, a young thief and an old priest.\n\nNow, we all know that Jubei easily takes out all of his adversaries, but what's surprising is that Shigure and her new posse are able to take out their foe, the giant cyclops that could easily crush them all with one stomp of his foot. Good work guys! So Jubei eventually catches up to the gang and hands over the Dragon Stone to Shigure, however he continues to travel with them... more or less... as they make their way to the city of Yagyu. It makes sense, as what kind of Ninja Scroll series would this be if Jubei just left for most of the series? Of course, it's also a good thing he stuck around to protect Shigure and the Dragon Stone since all kinds of very imaginative and creatively designed monster creatures are trying to get the blasted thing.\n\nThe DVD's include a bunch of extra features, like audio commentaries, various interviews, behind-the-scenes, a trivia game, clan profiles, the top ten battles, watching the creation of the cover art, an art gallery, and storyboard to feature comparisons. And these are spread out among the four discs, not just all crammed onto the last disc. The four disc \n DVD set also includes a little booklet insert that gives short summaries for each of the thirteen episodes, plus lists all the chapters for each episode as well as some art scattered around. The DVD's are all single sided, too, with some nice artwork, so all in all, it's a nice package." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2003" ], "title" : [ "Ninja Scroll TV" ], "director" : [ "Sato Tatsuo" ], "released" : [ "13 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ninja_scroll_tv/ninja_scroll/jubei.htm", "name" : "Jubei Kibagami" }, { "name" : "Nekome" }, { "name" : "Aizen" }, { "name" : "Nenmu" }, { "name" : "Azami" }, { "name" : "Nubatama" }, { "name" : "Dakatsu" }, { "name" : "Rengoku" }, { "name" : "Dakuan" }, { "name" : "Roga" }, { "name" : "Genza" }, { "name" : "Rokai" }, { "name" : "Hakurou" }, { "name" : "Shigure" }, { "name" : "Jyashi" }, { "name" : "Tsubute" }, { "name" : "Kawahori" }, { "name" : "Ubume/Yadorigi" }, { "name" : "Kitsunebi" }, { "name" : "Yamidoro" }, { "name" : "Kugutsu" }, { "name" : "Yamikubo" }, { "name" : "Magai" }, { "name" : "Zanba" }, { "name" : "Mozuku" }, { "name" : "Zofu" }, { "name" : "Mufu" } ], "genre" : [ "Eastern Fantasy", "Martial Arts" ] } }

Three years since the lovely Mariko Misowa broke up with her boyfriend, Harukiko Shimatsuki. In that time, Harukiko, or Haru for short, finished school and is now going to be teaching at college... well, in the English version at least. The US companies have a habit of transforming high schools into colleges for hentai titles in order to make the girls more \"legal\". So I'm positive this is actually a high school in the Japanese version. Anyway, back to the story...\n\nHaku enters his apartment, and is stunned to find the pink-haired Chitose Misowa, Mariko's younger sister, waiting for him inside. Chitose shows him the key to his apartment that Mariko had thrown away. She had been keeping it, she tells Haku, because all that time she has been deeply in love with him. After exposing her feelings, she feels that perhaps she shouldn't have revealed herself in such a fashion, but Haku quickly dissolves all doubts as he eases her clothes off and takes her virginity.\nThe next day Professor Haruhiko is introduced to his class... and who does he see is one of his students? Why Chitose of course! And when Chitose discovers that that Haru will be her professor, her thoughts instantly flow to the previous night when he taught her all about becoming a woman. Of course, she can't say anything to anyone, but that doesn't stop her from smiling! Besides, as long as she has him, it doesn't matter if nobody else can know.\n\nBut Chitose isn't the only woman on campus that has feelings toward Haru. Well, at first Ms. Tagami had a crush on another man, but on the same day she made him a special lunch from her heart, she finds out that he's getting married ... or so she says. I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be real or just an excuse to offer the lunch to Haku. Whatever the reason, he accepted the invitation, and if she didn't have an infatuation with the handsome Mr. Shimatsuki before, she sure did after the lunch.\n\nThere is also a subplot going on involving Chitose being on the swim team and having a lot of pressure to lead the school to victory. Oh yeah, and Ms. Tagami just so happens to be the swimming instructor, certified by the Aquatics Assosciation no less. I'm sure that will probably makes things get weird later on. I've only seen the first episode though, so I can't tell you for sure.\nAnd while this is probably just because I've only seen the first episode, I have to mention that this is the first hentai title I've seen where only one couple has sex. I assume we are treated to more variety in the additional episodes, but for this one episode it just seemed very sweet. Oh, and speaking of sweet, Haku normally seems like such a sweet guy, but get him in the bedroom and his kindy side starts to come out. Of course, his kinky side is still extremely mild compared to a lot of other hentai titles.\nThis was a nicely drawn title. The characters looked great and were all nicely proportioned, without any extreme exagerations. The animation was also smooth, and you could tell they didn't cheap out like other titles tend to do. The story looked like it could have gotten pretty good, but it seems I'll have to wait until another time to find out for sure.", "After the first episode, Haru has used not only the lovely young pink haired Chitose, but also the swim coach, and the long haired blue haired girl. Also, Haru, it seems, is very stupid, or dense, when he is teaching.\nAs for when he is about to use the Chitose for sex, he turns into something a little bit more. He likes bondage, I can tell you that, and likes to celebrate Chitose's accomplishments in odd ways, which I can describe with one word... \"Candles\".\nIn the end, it turns out that Haru has sex with Professor Tagami and Hotori, and later on Haru has a threesome with Chitose and Tagami." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2000" ], "title" : [ "Natural" ], "company" : [ "Green Bunny" ], "released" : [ "4 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Chitose Misowa" }, { "name" : "President" }, { "name" : "Dean" }, { "name" : "Professor Akagi" }, { "name" : "Head" }, { "name" : "Professor Haruhiko Shimatsuki" }, { "name" : "Hotori" }, { "name" : "Professor Tagami" }, { "name" : "Mariko Misowa" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai", "Romance" ] } }

That includes buildings that slide underground and piloted prototype robot warriors...with extension cords.\nThe only criticism that can be made is that unlike \n and \n, the ending of the TV series is pretty disappointing. Fortunately, they made \n to replace the final two episodes of the TV series, which more than made up for the original disappointment.", "Ok, here's the story folks. Evangelion takes place in the future 2015, 15 years after the famed, \"Second Impact\". \n, a somewhat lonesome boy, is standing around in the deserted streets of Tokyo-3. This openeing scene marks the beginning of a voilent, dramatic, humorous, and just plain, heart-touching series. The movie itself is centered around one of those \"secret\" organizations. This particular organization is called NERV. Their mission is to defend the planet from unknown threats.\nI won't say too much 'cause my friend wanted this to be an intro not a spoiler. Some of the characters are \n, the lonely kid; his father, head of NERV; \n, \n's guardian and friend; Rei, a mysterious pilot; \n, an egotistical pilot; and of course, the EVA units!

The Movies are called, \"Death and Rebirth\" and \"The End of Evangelion\"", "I will be contrary here and disagree slightly with the very enthusiastic reviewers.\nNGE is one of the most impressive things ever animated. The effort that was put into it on every level, from music to voice acting to art to animation, is awe-inspiring. The script and plotting are intelligent without being pretentious--at first, anyway.\nBut the series gets derailed right around Episode 24 and goes spiraling down into the Black Pit of WTF. There are rumors about the reasons for this, and if you're an anime fan you've probably heard them already. And if you didn't like the way NGE ended (and most viewers didn't), then \"\n\" and \"\n\" will probably leave you so frustrated that you may want to put your fist through the TV screen. Likewise, there are rumors about why Hideki Anno made these artistic choices, which I won't repeat here. You've probably already heard them anyway.\nUltimately it's a flawed masterpiece. When it is good it is breathtaking. It isn't hyperbole to say that, once you've seen it, you will probably never look at animation quite the same way again. But the end of the series is ghastly, and the movies are everything that was bad about the ending multiplied a hundred times, combined with even more impressive animation, art, voice acting, and music.\nIt's extremely frustrating and it could have been so much better than it was.", "Neon Genesis Evangelion contains many religious connections and connotations. Here are a few, so take from them what you will...\nAccording to the Old Testament of the Bible, Angels are the servants of God. It also represents the 12 disciples of Christ in the New Testament.\nBased on the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, Adam was the first man to have been created by God in his own image.\nThe organization called \"Seele\" means \"Soul\" in German.\nEvangelion is a word taken from the German word: evangelium, which has religious connotations meaning Gospel. It is also used as a slang to mean Absolute Truth.\nEva is a German word for Eve, a religious word derived from the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. According to the Bible, Eve was the wife of Adam, the first man to be created by God in his likeness. She tempted Adam into eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, and was exiled forever as punishment for disobeying God.(You probably already knew that)\nThe A10 nerve, the nerve \n uses to synchronize, is also the nerve that produces natural morphine in our brains, also known as the pleasant section of the brain. It is also the section that manages our long term memories.\nThe word Muldock, from the Muldock Report, is a word taken from one of the gods of the Babylon Empire\nThe four main eva's (\n, \n, \n, \n) are based on the Guardians of one of the gate's of hell.

Although \n doesn't drink, he eventually agrees to accompany the Professor out, and boy what a mistake that was! \n quickly realizes that it's a gay club, but before he can leave, he starts feeling kind of woozy. That's because when \n wasn't looking, the Professor sliped some kind of drug in \n's tea. When \n can no longer stand, the Professor moves in and then attempts to molest him!

Sure enough, it was the same Kai Sagano from back in high school, the only first year student who really stood out in the Kendo club. And apparently Kai had a crush on \n.

Sorry, must have slipped my mind!\n\nSo talk about a crazy situation, two gay brothers who have a mob boss as a father happen to fall in love with the same man! What's in store for \n, \n, and Kai? Where in the world is this story heading? Those who have already enjoyed the popular manga from Kazuma Kodaka on which this anime is based should already know, but the rest of us will have to wait until the next episode to find out anything more since each DVD contains only one episode just over 30 minutes long.

There are also evil Saints in the story who are on the hostile side. It is said that every 200 years an evil will come back to Earth and try to rule the world, and at the same time, the Goddess Athena will be reincarnated to prevent the evil from accesion to power on Earth.\nThe story has five main chacters: \n the Pegasus Saint, \n the Dragon Saint, \n the Andromeda Saint, \n the Cygnus Saint, and \n the Phoenix Saint. The task of these Saints is to protect Athena, the Goddess of peace, and to defeat the evil forces.\nThe Saints wear special armour, which each has deserved after years of hard training. Their armour not only protects them from external impacts, but also gives them special abilities. The armour represents a star constellation, from which a Saint also gains his power, called 'cosmo'. The cosmo of a Saint is like an aura. According to the story, everyone has a cosmo, which he/she is able to discover.\nThe story consists of 114 episodes made for TV, and can be divided into six main parts:\nSaint Seiya brings the subjects of \"friendship\" and \"holding together\" to you in an amazing way. The feature also demonstrates that the \"bad guys\" can have their good sides, and needn't be only mad, dumb, and ugly. The enemies are not just there acting as \"cannon-fodder\", but they are fighting for an ideal they believe in, thus they have a reason to be. This makes them just as interesting and enoyable as the main characters.\nSaint Seiya has now been released in America by DiC, in two versions: a version of the series edited for television under the name \"Knights of the Zodiac\" (this is incidentally the title of the series as seen in Europe under various languages), and an uncut version released only on video (though A.D.

But now, the game has taken on a very sinister twist. \n had been a rather ordinary high school sophmore into the Duel Monsters card game...until he unlocked the power of one of the ancient artifacts: the Millennium Puzzle.\nNow \n and his friends have to pit their hearts and their dueling skills against the forces of darkness in struggles for loved ones, themselves, and ultimately the entire world.

On planet Earth, high-tech buildings create an imposing cityscape as air transports zip back and forth carrying scientists and policy makers to Earth's most important building, the headquarters of Galaxy Garrison. This towering structure is the nervecenter for the all-important federation known as the Galaxy Alliance, a coalition of good planets and star systems that works for freedom and peace in the universe. Unfortunately, many of these planets have become overcrowded, creating serious inner and inter-planetary problems.\nUnder the direction of its wise leader, Space Marshall Graham, the Galaxy Garrison Council has adopted a bold plan to solve this critical problem. They have commisioned a state-of-the-art Star Cruiser to undertake a very special expedition into regions of deep space that have never before been explored. Its mission is to discover new habitable planets for colonization, while encouraging inhabited planets to join the Galaxy Alliance. And so...\nCommander Hawkins has located an inviting planet that he believes may be habitable. He sends his best team of Space Explorers - the ace pilots of the colorful Air, Sea, and Land Teams - down to the planet to investigate. Their findings are very encouraging; the planet appears to be suitable for human life. Listening in on their transmission the Drules smile; this is what they have been waiting for! In a swift decisive move, the Drules attack with overwhelming forces, confident that this single Star Ship and its meager explorer craft will not stand a chance against them. And indeed they would be right, but the Drules have failed to account for one important factor...\nThe First Voltron - the legendary super robot of the far universe composed of 5 robot lions - has long been the key to the Alliance's defense system in that region of the universe. However, realizing that their new expedition would be journeying to space sectors far beyond the reach of even the mighty Voltron - the Alliance developed a new Voltron.\nWhen broken into its component parts, the new Voltron consisted of 15 exploration vehicles specially designed for planetary investigation. Though these vehicles were very efficient at their designated tasks, they hardly appeared to be a formidable adversary. It is for this reason that when the mighty Drule Attack Ships swooped down upon them, their Evil Commanders anticipated little resistance. Imagine their surprise when these 15 humble Exploration Vehicles flew together and suddenly transformed into an awesome super-robot: Voltron, Defender of the Universe!\nPiloted by its dashing captain, \n, the mighty Voltron swiftly unleashed its incredible power, defeating the numerically superior Drule Forces, and filling the air with its resounding battle cry: \"Let's go Voltron Force!\" The surprised Drules headed quickly for home to lick their wounds - and plot their revenge.", "The Vehicle Voltron team is comprised of 15 Vehicles broken into three seperate teams, the Air Team (consisting of Jeff, Rocky, Chip, Wolo, and Ginger), the Land team (Cliff, Marvin, Hutch, Murdoch, and Sinda), and the Sea Team (Cric, Shannon, Zandee, Tagor, and Lisa). Admiral Newley was in command of the force, and second to him was Commander Hawkins. Their main enemy was the Drule Empire attack fleet, which was a very nasty enemy indeed.

There may also have been a considerate amount of language blood, guts, and other such content either altered or edited out completely.

Differences in philosophy combined with struggles for economic resources led to an incident known as \"Bloody Valentine\", a devastating event that sparked open warfare between the two factions.\nOne year later, a ZAFT forces attack the space station Heliopolis.

The coordinators are people who at a very primitive state before birth had their genes altered to enhance their abilities (making them smarter, more efficient, and adaptable). The Naturals are the people who are ordinary humans and did not have their genes altered.\nThe Naturals (or the Earth Alliance) fight against the Zaft (or the Coordinators). The war broke out because of differences between the Naturals and the Coordinators, as well as for economic reasons.\nThe characters in this anime are designed with complex and uncertain emotions. \n, its leading character is a coordinator fighting alongside the Naturals. He was unwillingly forced into the war after witnessing the classified Gundam.\nHe did not wish to fight, but did anyway because of a feeling to protect his friends.

But the creators managed to wrangle a one month extension so they could wrap up the story, giving it a total of 43 episodes. After the 43 episodes were aired, the show was canceled.\nWhen the re-runs came, it started getting people's attention. In 1981, the show was so popular that the creators turned it into a movie trilogy. The first movie was basically made up of old TV footage, while the second movie had about 30% new animation, and the third movie had about 70% new animation. Anyway, both the TV show and the movies put Gundam at the top and spawned several sequels.\nAnd now, here's the story. Due to overcrowding on Earth, the 'Earth Federation' starts construction on space colonies called 'Sides'. Ever since then, over half of the world's population has lived peacefully in these Sides, until the year UC (Universal Century) 0079.\nColonists of Side 3, calling themselves 'The Independent Duchy of Zeon', declare their independence from the Federation and declare war. Nine months pass, with Zeon getting the upper hand thanks to their mobile weapons called 'Zakus', and over half of the world's population dead. But then the Federation constructs the Assault Carrier White Base and the Mobile Suit Gundam to counterattack the Zeon. They are moved to Side 7 where the Zeon try to screw the whole plan up by destroying the research labs. In the midst of the conflict, a 15-year old teen named \n (son of Tem Ray, the man behind the Gundam project) encounters the Gundam, and with the manual on his lap, combats the Zakus and beats them. Soon after, \n and friends are enrolled into the White Base, and so they set off battling all Zeon they encounter along the way.

(that is until later in the series he gets reunited with a little girl named \n who was talking with him on Mars and was presumed dead with the other habitants).\nA year later, Akito is a fry cook trying to forget about the incident. However, the Jovian Lizards return and Akito's fear of them causes him to get fired at the restaurant he was working in. While job hunting, he gets re-united with 20 year-old Yurika Misumaru who was Akito's former neighbor on Mars, and lover who dedicated her life to making his life a living hell. When he follows her to Nergal Heavy Industries, Akito learns that Yurika is the captain of the High Mobile Battleship Nadesico that will embark on a journey to defeat the Jovian Lizards.

The Ohmu would topple cities, and kill people until they died of starvation.

Lord Yupa is visiting the valley of the wind. King Jhil is bedridden because of the jungle's poisons. There is also a legend that goes \"After a thousand years of darkness, he will come.

Jack Grimes was the voice of Professor Fumble and Splasher and Peter Fernandez (other work includes The Space Giants, Ultraman, and Star Blazers-aka Space Battleship Yamoto and most of the Godzilla films) was the voice of Piper and Dr Mariner and later went on to be Speed from Speed Racer. Jack Curtis was the voice of Bulton. Warner Brothers bought out Seven Arts and its library and holds all the Marine Boy masters. They have no plans to do anything with them (production info and voice credits from Andy Shepherd).\nThe whole series was set around Ocean Patrol Headquarters under the sea, responsible for making the oceans of the world safe. The main patrol boat was the P1, led by Marine Boy and his 2 crew members Piper (the skinny one) and Bolton (fatter with a deeper voice). The sub fired torpedoes and had a chute underneath where Marine Boy would swim in and out. Like all ocean patrol recruits, they wore red berets as part of their uniform. The entire operation was run by Dr Mariner who was Marine Boy's father, with the help of Professor Fumble (has a huge nose) who comes up with fabulous inventions to help Marine Boy defeat his foes.\nMarine Boy doesn't seem to have a normal name. His father refers to him as Son or Marine Boy. He has red hair with an orange suit made out of a special material to give him protection. His main weapon is a sonic boomerang that he keeps in a pouch on his left arm, and he moves through the water as fast as the marine life, powered by propeller shoes. He can stay underwater for great lengths of time through chewing \"oxygum\". Splasher (a white dolphin) and Neptina (a mermaid) are two of his underwater friends that help him in his adventures. Neptina wears a huge pearl around her neck that has special powers, including seeing into the future to warn Marine Boy of danger. Cli Cli (a small boy) often tries to help Marine Boy but usually causes more trouble." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1969–1971" ], "title" : [ "Kaitei Shounen Marine", "Seabottom Boy Marine" ], "company" : [ "Japan Telecartoons", "K.

In fact, they seem down right nasty as they appear to be hell bent on eradicating every human on the planet. The military scrambles to defend their home world, but they are no match for the alien technology which crushes their vehicles like insects. But then something odd happens... one of the aliens actually leaves the safety of the ship and comes down to the planet, landing nearby Tetsuya, a hapless photographer. All he can do snap pictures while he witnesses the beautiful green-haired Princess Kahm, dressed in some sort of weird armored bikini, brutally slice and dice a bunch of soldiers with her sword. Once they're out of the picture, she turns her attention to the timid Tetsuya.\nTetsuya can do nothing as he sees her toss aside the bodiless head of her most recent victim and start walking towards him. But then, just as she strikes, he stumbles and blocks with his camera, causing the flash to go off and momentarily blinding our lovely princess. Tetsuya sees this as his one chance to strike, and lunges toward her... which lands them both in an up close and personal embrace, where Tetsuya is unintentionally treated to a crystal clear view of Kahm's cleavage. Kahm, who can literally feel Tetsuya's excitement at what he's seeing, takes it upon herself to stop trying to kill him. Instead, she leans in and gives him a nice kiss... just before bonking him on the head to knock him out.\n\nTetsuya awakes on her ship, surrounded by some short, strange-looking green creatures who help to fill him in on what's going on. Apparently, he is now Kahm's fiancé! Needless to say, Tetsuya is shocked, and so he takes one of the little green fellows hostage and demands to be taken back to Earth. So Kahm has to cut her bath short in order to come deal with the situation, and this is where Tetsuya learns another astonishing fact... her father fully intends to kill every human alive, and the only way to prevent this is for Kahm to actually marry one of them! Upon learning this tiny little detail, Tetsuya calms down and accepts Kahm as his new fiancé.\n\nOf course, the show isn't over yet! First Princess Kahm's best friend, Battia, drops in and picks on her for wanting to marry such a loser, and so they end up having a friendly little sword battle over it. Then Fleet Commander Progress stops by to get the Princess for an audience with her father, since she is already set to marry someone that he picked out. And then good old beast-man Geobaldi says hi by gently nudging his ship into the top of Kahm's. And so with all but one of the major players introduced, it's now time to go meet daddy!\n\nDaddy, also known as the Emperor, has already picked out a fiancé for his daughter, so when he learns of Tetsuya, he orders him to be executed! Poor Tetsuya! If Princess Kahm is going to have any chance of choose her own fate and marrying Tetsuya, she's gonna need some help from friends in order to rescue her groom and escape from her father with enough time to elope and consancrate the marrige. Now, somewhere in here there is some kind of fancy space maneuver which helps them to escape, though I really couldn't tell you what it is because they kind of didn't tell us!\nIn fact, this show seems to have a habit of skipping over so major details and plot points. Why? Because they're trying to cram an entire manga series into only 48 minutes, which is really too bad because this was enjoyable enough to warrant more. At the very least I think it could have benefited from being a three episode OVA series. Do you hear me out there?! Fourty-eight minutes is not enough! Go remake this into a longer series right now!", "This 20th Anniversary Edition released by \n has been completely re-dubbed from the previous Dark Image Entertainment release. And what's more, the English voice actors were chosen by fans. Auditions were posted on the internet, and fans voted on who they wanted. This could have easily gone very, very wrong, but luckily for us all it seemed to work pretty good.\nI noticed that the dialog for the dubbed version doesn't always match that of the Japanese dialog, and I'm not just talking about little things like slang or needing to reword something so that it can fit with the lip movements. I'm referring to some major differences, such as the English version saying it was just a coincidence that both Kahm and Tetsuya spoke the same language, while in the Japanese version it's implied that they can understand each other because Kahm kissed Tetsuya.\nAlso, there are some other points in the dub where dialog was added where none existed originally. This new dialog mostly seemed to be little jokes, and although some of them would occasionally bring about a chuckle, I think they actually changed the intended mood of the scene, and would have rather had the original mood than a slight chuckle.\nThe extra features on the DVD include a short featurette about selection the English voice actors, and many, many previews for other releases. I watched all of these, and really enjoyed most of them. They got me excited to see some of these releases that I had never even heard of, such as Otaku Unite and a second installment of \n. I just can't wait to see those! Otaku Unite releases on March 7, and Animation Runner Kuromi 2 will be released on May 9, 2006... why so long?!" ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1986" ], "creator" : [ "Johji Manabe" ], "company" : [ "Tatsunoko Prod.", "Ltd.", "Victor Ent.

(Hey, kinda sounds like what Disney did to \n when it released The Lion King.)\nThe drawings are AWESOME. For an early 80's show, the drawings in this were incredibly detailed. What I loved best, and probably the main draw of the show, were the numerous vehicles the Thunderbirds used to use. They didn't use to transform or anything, but the main three did used to combine into this big, bad-ass ship. The animation was also quite good, though it was no match for full-length anime features...\nThis show did have one major flaw: It was dull. Even though the later episodes in the series did provide the Thunderbird team with an enemy to fight, there weren't many dog-fights or any kind of confrontations in this show. This was evidenced by the fact that the Thunderbirds' vehicles had almost no weapons. That's what you have to expect with a team whose main purpose is rescue operations.. Ah well... It also had a very stereotypical black character, Little John, but I suppose that's better than no black character, which is most common...\nThis show was pretty cool, but at the same time it was pretty dull.

Unfortunately, \n lives in a men's dorm which does not permit any women inside, so he and \n are literally tossed out by his sempai.

The Fates were part a group of Valkyries.\nIn the legend, the keeper of magic and judge of men's fate was Urthr. The Nordic used the \"th\" and a \"d\" to represent the same sound. So, Urthr and Urdrth would be on the same line. Like \n in the anime, she was older and commanded lightning.\nThe other side is Skuld. The name never needed to be changed in the legend or in the anime. Skuld was the Fate responsible to create Men and to give them knowledge on the battlefield. She also helped with the crafts of war. Skuld commanded water and rain. Skuld would create the Thread of Men (explained below).\nVerthanthi was the Fate of the Present. She would watch over the men on the battlefield and direct the Valkyries accordingly. On rare instances, she would hold the Thread of Men too long, giving someone longevity. The keeper of the sun's warmth and song made Verthanthi the more liked Fate. The translation to Japanese was difficult. A pure \"R\" sound gets blurred into a \"L\" sound (\"fried rice\" would sound like \"flied lice\"). The \"V\" sound was replaced the less harsh \"B\" sound, and the \"th\" was again replaced with \"D\". So, the translation went like this:\n\nVe(l)thanthi --> (B)elthanthi --> Bel(d)an(d)i --> Beldandi --> Belldandy\nMost Nordic Legends can be found in \n.

Would it be an awesome series of animated perfection like \n, or would it turn out to be just another bland TV show made for children that lacks real drama and fails to establish a real emotional connection? Thankfully, Oban Star-Racers turned out to be the former, an excellent series that will easily hook both kids and adults into the arcing story and keep them entertained up until the final episode. The only disappointment here is that the series has to end. I seriously hope a second season will be considered.\nThe story starts in the year 2082, where we meet a girl named \n, who has just turned 15 years old. Living at a boarding school, \n is desperately hoping for some kind of contact from her father, \n, whether it be a birthday present or a simple phone call. But it has been years since she has seen her dad, and she's fed up with waiting, so \n decides it's time for an early graduation and takes off on her hover bike. As \n is the well-known owner of Wei Racing, she knows exactly where to find him, but when the two are finally standing face-to-face, he doesn't even seem to recognize her. \n quickly makes the decision to provide him with a false name, taking the name \"\n\" from a nearby poster.\nAfter she fixes one of his racers, he agrees to keep her on his team, though soon he learns that his team has been selected to represent Earth in an intergalactic race, and she is not invited along. But \n is one tough cookie and refuses to lose her father again. Stowing away aboard the starship that transports the team to the distant planet on which the first rounds of racing take place. And it turns out to be a good thing she did, because the team's pilot, \n, becomes injured during the first race when their racer explodes.\nNow \n must take over as pilot for the Earth team, much to the dismay of \n, who apparently feels that women have absolutely no place in racing. All is not smooth-sailing from here on out, however. Not only does the Earth team does not win every race, but even for the ones they do win, they don't necessarily come through unscathed. But pulling out of the race is not an option, as the fate of the entire world, and possibly the entire galaxy, depends on the Earth team coming through to the very end. Friends and enemies, pitfalls and perils, mystery and loyalty, they all play a part in this action-packed series.\nThe art style is quite unique (such as how none of the characters have noses drawn on them), but it works extremely well. The aliens are all interestingly designed, and even the specific individuals of the various races have uniqueness, so they're not just one design that's cloned over and over. The character designs, mech designs, and even backgrounds all have great attention to detail, which goes far into helping the audience feels as though we are in a real universe.\nThe two-volume DVD release contains all twenty-six episodes, uncut. Since I hadn't seen the show on television, I cannot tell you how the uncut episodes differ from those that were broadcast. But it shouldn't really matter, as either way you'll most definitely want to pick up this series on DVD. There are also some extras features on board. Each volume contains a making-of featurette, star-racer profiles, and original concept art. Volume one gives you a sneek peek at volume two, while volume two gives you the original MIPCOM presentation (MIPCOM is a trade show) and a complete opening title sequence.\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone and everyone!", " is French/Japanese collaboration.\nIn the year 2057, after a devastating attack by a ruthless race called the Crogs, Earth is invited by the mysterious Avatar to participate in the great race of Oban, where the winner will be granted any wish.\nRepresenting Earth is a racing team owned by one \n.

Risa is self-conscious and loves gaming, while Otani is rather loud and a comedian.\nWithin the course of the anime, they appear to think they are friends, and even help each other try to get dates with crushes Chiharu Tanaka (Otani) and Ryoji Suzuki (Risa).\nYet, Risa falls in love with Otani on the way.... I won't spoil any more, but overall Lovely COmplex is very enjoyable!", "High school love is not so kind for the All Hanshin Kyojin Koizumi Risa-who is taller than the average girl-and Ootani Atsushi-who's shorter than the average guy.\nIt all begins when Koizumi, Ootani, Nobuko, Rakao, Chiharu, and Suzuki all go swimming, thanks to Koizumi's brilliant idea to get Suzuki to like her, only to spend the entire time with Ootani. Thus, Chiharu and Suzuki make the second couple, with Nobuko and Rakao being the first. Skip a few episodes, and Koizumi starts to like Ootani when they go to an Omibouzo Christmas concert.\nFrom there Koizumi puts all her heart into winning Ootani's, with obstacle after obstacle in her way. These include: a victim of childhood bullying that Koizumi defended who's till in love with her moves back to Osaka, Ootani's ex trying to win him back, and a homosexual transvestite who goes by the name of Seiko-chan whom gives Ootani his first kiss being the most hilarious. When she finally does tell him, he thinks she's making fun of him. It does take quite a few episodes for him to figure it out, after she puts it so blatantly, again. Turns out he just can't think of her as a girlfriend for being best friends for so long.\nSkip ahead. Yeah, he can, so they start going out, but then College Exams are coming up and Ootani has to go to cram school, taking up all his free time. Koizumi wants to walk with him more often, so she gets a job as a waitress-a very clumsy one at that. Here she meets her haggy boss, and her friend Kohori. But he thinks of her as more than a friend. One day she stays at work late and falls asleep trying to memorize the menu. Kohori is just about to kiss her when she wakes up, and at the same moment-as luck would have it-Ootani shows up to walk her home only to find her cheating. She pleads and he gives her a second chance. She blows it when Kohori asks her as a friend to see the latest Omibouzo concert. Against her better judgement she goes, and once again is caught. Ootani dumps her, but she's persistant to win him back.\nAfter all the hooplah, they end up together again, and it's the day before exams. Everyone in Ootani's house has the flu, so he's kicked out of his home, and none of his friend's will take him in. He ends up going to Koizumi's, where he meets her extremely tall-and nutty-family. That night it snows and they're all locked in, but Koizumi won't let him give up on his dream to become an elementary school gym teacher. She bike-rides him to the nearest subway, and he goes, and takes the test, and PASSES! YAY! She fells bad because she doesn't know what she wants to do with her life. On the way to celebrate, they come along their model friend Mimi during a photo shoot. The photographer demands she be a model for a bit, and she reluctantly agrees. While she is amazingly cute, she is stiff in front of the camera, but she meets the stylist, and she finally realises her call in life. SHE'S GOING TO BE A STYLIST!\nIt all ends with the cutest kiss scene ever, they're in the park walking on stairs and he asks her to turn around and he kisses her. Cute why?

Along the way, he meets a sexy young woman named Meow who is also traveling to Little Monica. She is dressed in an erotic skin-tight cat outfit, complete with tail. She tells Will that she is a performer making her way to Little Monica to put on a show at some exclusive club, and Will is excited to hear it. Will thinks back to the town he loved, how full of artistic expression it was, and specifically how much he loved the performances that were showcased in the exclusive amphitheater she mentioned. So Will decides to check out the show before heading over to meet his old \"girlfriend\".\n\nAs he waits in the dark room with all the other patrons for the show to begin, he immediately notices something different about the place. Instead of smelling all elegant from all the lords and ladies dressed up nice to take in a lovely, cultured evening show, the room was ripe with a stench like that from a crowd of fat, sweaty men. Then the stage lights flick on, and reveal the lovely Meow, still dressed in her skin-tight kitty outfit... though not for long. The realization that Ms. Meow is actually putting on a strip show quickly overwhelms our young, homesick boy, though that doesn't stop him from watching, of course! And it's a good thing too, because then he might have missed out on the second part of the show....\n\nOnce the stripping portion was over and Meow was completely bare, she then moved on to the next part of her routine: selecting one of the men from her captive audience to come up on stage, get naked, and have sex with her right then and there! Hmm, I wonder who she'll pick... fat, sweaty guy number one? No... old, sweaty guy number two? No... handsome, young Will? Bingo! At first he's nervous about doing this in front of a whole group of horny guys, but one whisper from Meow about how she'll make him forget all about them hits the mark and they start going at it without regard to anyone else. And apparently Will is \"the man\", because when it's over she lets him know that this was the first time she ever had a real orgasm up on stage. You go, Will!\n\nWill's next stop is to find his old friend, Celia. He reaches the house, and her two sisters, Tina and Mei, answer the door, though it's not long before Celia herself arrives home. Each of them has grown into beautiful young women, and they're all very happy to see that Will has returned. They invite him to stay with them while he learns about what kind of place their town has become in his absence. Oh, and they also introduce him to some weird floating puff-ball creature that apparently just showed up one day. They don't know where it came from or why it showed up, and it really doesn't even seem to serve any purpose, at least until this one day when Will, Celia, and her sisters were all sitting around and Kajo burst through the door!\n\nKajo is the evil man who runs the town nowadays. He removed all culture from the once elegant city, and replaced it with debauchery. He also banned all music for some odd reason, except for during the strip shows for which the announcer was able to convince him that she show would be no good without it. So now Kajo and his two henchmen make a surprise entry into Celia's house and demands that all three of the girls get naked at once! Will tries to fight them off, to no avail. The floating blob, however, begins to play a tune on its violin, which seems to cause Kajo to become instantly ill. Not being able to stand it, Kajo takes his leave, and has his henchmen follow, while Will and the girls are left wondering what the heck that was all about.\n\nSoon another plot starts to develop, which has something to do with the spirit of Little Monica, the woman for whom the town was named after, hiding in someone's body, and a prophecy about obtaining complete control of the city which Kajo is after. It all seems to make sense when your watching it, but mostly I think you'll just be focusing on all the sex scenes, which are extremely well done. This is a very light hearted title, with all the sex being consensual and enjoyed. A lot of pastels are used, which fit the tone nicely. The character designs are also well done and properly proportioned. If you're new to the \n, this would be an excellent film to start with, and if you're not new to the genre, this would still make an excellent addition to your collection. Very highly recommended!", "Orphaned thirteen years ago, young Will is returning to his hometown of Little Monica, where he hope to bring what he learned from his studies abroad. In Will's memory, Little Monica was a happy town, a cultural center that was brimming with music and smiles.\nBut when Will returned, he is shocked that the town, which was now run by a sleazy, music-hating dirtbag named Kajo, had degenerated into a sad place, where the former concert hall had been turned into a strip joint.

The five remaining OVA episodes were not based on the books, but rather were simply a conclusion created from scratch to tie up the series, since continuing with the story from the books would have either ended the series in the middle of a story arc or have taken way too many episodes to reach a spot with a satisfactory conclusion. Thus, the TV series completely ignores those final five episodes in order to continue the story as it happened in the books.\nIt has been five years since the War of Heroes ended, and now the evil \n is out looking for a magical item called the scepter of domination so that he can rule all of Lodoss. He visits Neese at the Temple of Marfa, hoping that this was the treasure that the ancient dragon Bramd gave to her, though when he learns that she sold the dragon's treasure to pay for upkeep of the temple, he realizes it could not have been what he was after. But at least Neese now knows that \n is back, so she can give fair warning to \n and the gang. Let's just hope there's enough time to stop him!\n\nMeanwhile, \n and \n arrive in town of Zaxon on a mission to collect taxes for the kingdom, though the villagers claim that they are independent and not part of the kingdom. \n expected as much, and came prepared to fight. So apparently they're not aware that this is the home town of \n, the heroic free knight. Initially, a sorcerer named Cecil that \n left in charge while he was away came out to face the mercenaries. The dope quickly falls into a trap they set for him, but is soon rescued when \n and \n arrive on scene. After a quick battle where \n turns into a raging berserker, unable to tell friend from foe, they all become friends and head into town.\n\nWhile there, \n arrives and gets the gang up to date on what \n's up to, so they all head out to Flaim in hopes of sign up the great \n to join their quest. It's not long after arriving in Flaim that \n finds himself helping out a poor civilian being terrorized by a group of soldiers. When the military actually realizes who \n is, they immediately feel stupid and escort the group to Castle Akroyd. After a discussion on the current situation, they figure that since they don't know which of the two most likely dragons has the treasure that \n is after, there is no other choice than to split up into two groups, with each taking a dragon.\n\n\n leads the first group, consisting of \n and \n, and they head off to Fire Dragon Mountain to find the dragon called Shooting Star. \n is put in charge of the second group, and he, along with \n and Cecil, head off to Blue Dragon Island to check out the water-dragon Abram. Unbeknownst to both parties, \n has decided to try his luck at Blue Dragon Island first, though \n's group is unable to make an attempt at him due to the fact that they were captured by pirates! \n, \n, \n, what are we gong to do with you? But on the bright side, \n doesn't find what he's looking for at Blue Dragon Island. Of course, with every bright side, there's a dark side....\n\nBut wait! This fantastic adventure all comes to an exciting conclusion in episode eight! And there are still 19 more episodes to go! What's a show to do? Well, if you're this show, you'll start a completely new storyline, this time focusing on the youngster named \n whom we met briefly earlier in the series, though now it is ten years later and \n is well on his way to becoming a knight like his idol, \n. This new adventure sends \n out to stop an evil sorcerer named \n, who is bound and determined to resurrect the mega nasty Kardis! Sure sounds exciting! But honestly, I much preferred the first part of the series. The second part got me a little confused....\n\nAt the end of each episode there is a little short called \"Welcome to Lodoss Island\" in which cute, simply-animated child-like versions of the characters play out a funny little skit. The first was great, with them giving a simple, easy-to-understand summary of episode. The following skits were also funny, but they didn't summarize the plot in any way, which is unfortunate because both my wife and I thought that was a great idea, so that's why after the first one, we found the rest were a bit disappointing. Oh yeah, I should also point out that the animation isn't a good as the OVA series, but that's pretty typical, as TV series usually aren't due to budget and time constraints.\nOn a side note, Central Park Media has recently repriced the DVD set of Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of Heroic Knight to $39.99. Also, Central Park Media has made the first episode available for \n, along with many other of its titles." ], "jp_info" : { "title" : [ "Lodoss Tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den" ], "company" : [ "AIC" ], "director" : [ "Nobuhiro Takamoto" ], "released" : [ "27 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/ashram.htm", "name" : "Ashuram" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/orson.htm", "name" : "Orlson" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/deedlit.htm", "name" : "Deedreet" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/parn.htm", "name" : "Pan" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/beld.htm", "name" : "Deedreet" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/pirotess.htm", "name" : "Pirotase" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/etoh.htm", "name" : "Eto" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/shiris.htm", "name" : "Seeris" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/ghim.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/slayn.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/karla.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/spark.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/fahn.htm", "name" : "King Fan" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/wagnard.htm", "name" : "Bugnard" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/kashue.htm", "name" : "Lord Cashew" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/woodchuck.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/leylia.htm", "name" : "Reilia" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/record_of_lodoss_war/wort.htm", "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Adventure", "Fantasy" ] } }

It was produced as a joint effort by Sunrise Animation Studio and Nagoya Television. It first aired in Japan on April 30th, 1988 and ran weekly through March 4th, 1989. Yoroiden Samurai Troopers (YST) was a far bigger success than was Ronin Warriors (its American dub). YST was originally planned for only 19 episodes but the popularity of the show prompted the producers to extend it for another season for a total of 39 episodes\nYoroiden Samurai Troopers is the story about five teenage boys, given mystical armor to protect the world from the evil \n. The story begun 1000 years ago, when \n wanted to take over the ningenkai. He almost succeed when \n managed to defeat him. However, although \n's soul is banished to the Youjakai, his armor is left intact. The armor therefore becomes a link for \n to come back to Ningenkai.\n\n\n divided the armor into nine separate armor suits. Each armor will choose its bearer, and together they will fight \n. At least that's the original intention (well, you know what happened next, don't you? ^^). \n finds out \n's plan, and thus attempts to find the armor himself. He manages to find four suits of armor with their four bearers, and persuaded them to follow (and serve) him. Those four are \n, \n, \n, and \n. After they follow \n, they become his MaSho (demon general).\nThe rest of the armor, however, is still safe within \n's protection. The bearer of these fives suits of armors are called Samurai Troopers. They are \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n. Each represents an element of nature and has a \"kanji\" that suits their personality.", "There are 3 OVA series. The first is a two-episode series called \n (Ronin Warriors Gaiden). The second is a five-episode series titled \n which introduces a tribal warrior from Africa who wears a mysterious Black Armor that looks eerily similar to \n's Inferno Armor. At the end of this series, the five armors, as well as both Inferno Armors, are completely destroyed. The Third OVA series is called \n, and it introduces a strange woman from the Edo period who was involved with a play that actually foretold in striking detail the events of the Samurai Troopers battle with \n and the forces of the netherworld.\nThe play ended when the government accused everyone involved with it of treason and executed them, leaving behind this woman, who vows revenge against the armors. The series is mostly composed of images from the main series and the \"Legend of the Inferno Armor\" OVA with characters talking about various things that usually have absolutely nothing to do with the scene you're watching. By the end of \"Message\" each one of the five has a brand new Armor, born from this woman's hatred and sorrow. The Armors are still called the same things as the old ones and bear the same symbols, they just look different." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "April 30, 1988–March 4, 1989" ], "creator" : [ "Hajime Yadate" ], "company" : [ "SUNRISE", "Nagoya Broadcasting Network" ], "title" : [ "Yoroiden Samurai Troopers", "Legendary Armor Samurai Troopers" ], "director" : [ "Masashi Ikeda, Mamoru Hamatsu, Kazuki Akane" ], "released" : [ "39 TV episodes, 11 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/anubis.htm", "name" : "Shuten Doji" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/ryo.htm", "name" : "Ryo Sanada" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/cale.htm", "name" : "Anubisu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/sage.htm", "name" : "Seiji" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/cye.htm", "name" : "Shin Mouri" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/sekhmet.htm", "name" : "Naaza" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/dais.htm", "name" : "Rajura" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/talpa.htm", "name" : "Arago" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/kento.htm", "name" : "Shuu Fuan Rei" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/ancient.htm", "name" : "Kaosu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/kayura.htm", "name" : "Lady Kayura" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/white_blaze.htm", "name" : "Byakuen" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/mia.htm", "name" : "Nasutei Yagiyu " }, { "name" : "Dr. Yagyu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ronin_warriors/rowen.htm", "name" : "Toma" }, { "name" : "Jun Yamano" } ], "genre" : [ "Eastern Fantasy", "Action" ] } }

But one day after work something happens that makes him forget all his woes... he bumps into a gentleman who drops a bottle of pills with a label that reads \"Disappearing Tablets\". Before Mie can hand them back to the guy, he begins to sparkle and then vanishes into thin air!\nAs Mie stands in a daze trying to figure out exactly what happened, two school girls in traditional school uniforms with pleated short skits walk by, and whisper something unflattering about him as they pass. So Mie decides what the heck, and pops a pill. To test it out, he positions himself in the path of one of the girls, and when she unexpectedly bumps right into him, he knows he has something extremely amazing cooped up in a bottle. After lifting a few skirts to see their pretty panties, Mie decides to take it to the next level... and visits a bath house.\n\nAmazingly enough, Mie seems content to remain just a voyeur in this land of beautiful naked female flesh.

After a few pantie peaks while the girls hang around the classroom, he follows the lovely ladies into the locker room where he watches the do their thing. Once again Mie seems content with simply spectating. Unfortunately, one of the girls, Suzu, was late arriving, and thus is just getting started to change when all the rest are leaving... meaning Mie will have one all alone. As the rest of the girls head out, one jokingly warns Suzu that there is a ghost which attacks girls who are all alone.

In this series, the doctor's name is Jyunichi, and he's one hell of a surgeon. He's so good, in fact, that he has become the reputation of the entire hospital... and though he may feign modesty in public, privately he knows that he is the bomb! Oh, and that whole god's gift to women thing... that part may actually be somewhat true as well. Now, every nurse that he takes \"under his pants\" does resist at first, but shortly into their session each one of them is begging for more!\n\nNow, about the plot. It seems the president of the hospital is ill, and rumors have it that he's considering retirement, sooner than later. Doctor Jyunichi, with his outstanding reputation, is the forerunner for taking over the position, until the president's daughter, Serika, enters the picture. It seems she was away, training to be a doctor in the same field of medicine as Doctor Jyunichi. Coincidence? Yeah, right. Well, her training is done. She is now a full fledged doctor, and she's not only ready to take over for her father, she's ready, willing, and eager to fire Doctor Jyunichi!\n\nWhy would she want to get rid of such a brilliant, upstanding guy? Let's just say that it has to do with a little incident that happened several years prior. At any rate, Doctor Jyunichi isn't going down without a fight. Luckily, the good doctor's talent as a surgeon is matched by his talent as a... how do I say... fulfiller of women's pleasures. One by one Jyunichi turns the nurses into his sex slaves, completely wrapping them around his little finger... or other such extremity. And each slave is fully willing to help bring aboard the next member to their troupe.\n\nOnce the doctor's minions, Yayoi, Miyuki, Nanami, and Aya, are in place, it's time to start Operation: Discredit Serika! The nurses begin to secretly sabotage Doctor Serika in order to show her father and the board that she doesn't have what it takes to run the hospital. And it seems to be working! Doctor Serika can't figure out what's going on, and Doctor Jyunichi looks to be back as the front runner for replacing the president. Ah, but since when does a story end that smoothly! Will Serika catch on to Jyunichi's plan? And if so, will it be soon enough to stop it? Who will ultimately win out?

Maya, as always, is a gorgeous young woman with lovely assets just trying to make her way in the world... except now, she is a knight. She hides her womanhood, making everyone believe that she is just a feminine male. The only one who knows the truth is Count Calvin, who took her as an infant and hid her true past for fear of her life should anyone find out. Thus, she now goes by the name Mayatola Calvin, and is the commanding officer of the First Imperial guard.\nThe women all adore her, thinking that she is a man, but the evil Count Pickingel despises her. Why do I say \"evil\"? Well pretty much the first thing we see in this anime is Count Pickingel leading his men into a town where burns all the buildings, accuses all the women of being witches, and has his men rape them all. He stands at the center, surrounded by his men who are violating all the women right out in the open. Oh, but he's not content to just watch it happen; oh no, he joins in on the action too. Had it not been for Mayatola Calvin showing up, we can only imagine how this ugly scene would have played out to the end.\n\nOf course, Count Pickingel still has women chained up in his dungeon, so he's always able to relieve his desire for torture and sex when the need arises. But he's not the only sicko. By his side is a red-haired woman named Isabel, who gets off on the abuse as much as he does; feeling herself up while Pickingel has his way with a completely nude woman bound and chained in midair, haning upside down. And all the dungeon keepers seems to enjoy it as well. All the women there are thought to be witches, but I seriously doubt it matters one way or the other to these people.\nAnyway, Pickingel has a ninja-like dude shadow Maya to uncover what he can about her, so that he can destroy her. This is when we learn Maya has a servant girl named Anne, and even she doesn't know Maya is a woman. But unfortunately her secret is soon to be revealed! How it all plays out from here I will not say, but rest assured, just like in previous volumes, men will become powerless to resist desire for Maya, the Erotic Tempress!" ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1996" ], "title" : [ "Imma Youjo - Volume IV" ], "company" : [ "Pink Pineapple" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gallery/index.htm", "name" : " View Image Gallery" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume I" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_2/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume II" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_3/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume III" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_5/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume V" } ], "released" : [ "1 OVA episode" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Anne" }, { "name" : "Count Pickingel" }, { "name" : "Clory" }, { "name" : "Isabel" }, { "name" : "Count Calvin" }, { "name" : "Maya/Mayatola Calvin" }, { "name" : "Count Nicklal" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

They are enjoying themselves immensely until that final climatic moment arrives... and then for no apparent reason the dude seems to croak. Kinda odd, but then we hear the woman call a familiar name... Maya. A young lady responds, stepping out from where she was hiding, and although very beautiful, she has not the pink hair of the erotic temptress that we have come to know and love. This Maya has long, brown hair, and a very colorful tatoo filling her entire back. At any rate, the two hotties have a little session of their own, and such begins the third volume of the Imma Youjo series.\nThe scene shifts elsewhere, to some blue-haired guy walking down a road littered with the skeletal remains of dead soldiers. His name is Jyurota, a vassal of Nobutsuna Mochizuki, and he soon crosses paths with Shinbei, a foot soldier of Katsuyori Abe. Apparently that makes them enemies, though neither one seems to care much about that. Rather, Jyurota offers the starving Shinbei his rice ball, which sort of makes them friends, so Shinbei begins tagging along on Jyurota's journey as a guide.\n\nAlong their way they encounter and old woman who warns that they should not cross the mountains as there is a demon who seemingly spirits away all men who enter. Of course, that's not going to stop these guys, so they push on. But when they hear a cry for help from Maya who's being attacked by three thugs, their quest is instantly put on hold. The two smaller bandits where no sweat for Jyurota, but the third one was a giant, and was wearing a completely naked Maya like a human shield. This presents a problem, though no problem is unsolvable for these two.\n\nAfter rescuing Maya, she invites them to come to the palace to meet her master, the princess. And of course the princess turns out to be that woman we met in the first scene. Her name is Akina, and she is the daughter of a noble and his mistress, so for political reasons she was sent to live in this palace located deep in the forest. At any rate, she invites the pair to spend the night, to show her appreciation for them saving her servant. Two guys all alone in a palace with two gorgeous babes? Who in their right mind would turn that down!\nWell, both guys get what they were hoping for, but they also end up getting way more than they wanted. The story continues, but I don't want to give away the secret, even though you would have already probably figured it out by now. Apparently, this volume of the series doesn't have any connection to the first two, but on the plus side the story is the easiest one to follow so far." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1996" ], "title" : [ "Imma Youjo - Volume III" ], "company" : [ "Pink Pineapple" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gallery/index.htm", "name" : " View Image Gallery" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume I" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_2/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume II" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_4/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume IV" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_5/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume V" } ], "released" : [ "1 OVA episode" ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

As he escapes, his mind drifts back to him and his girl, and then to a group of guys taking his girl for their pleasure while holding him back and forcing him to watch. But theirs is not the only horror. Another young man tries frantically to escape an attack helicoper with his pretty young pink-haired girlfriend, but it is not to happen. After being brutally gunned down by the chopper, the girl is left standing all alone, right in its sights. But instead of firing, the copter simply explodes in mid air. This is the opening to Immage Youjo.\nDefinitely not your standard hentai opening scenes. But then this doesn't seem to be your average hentai series. Taking place sometime in the future, in what feels like a Mad Max type world, our young pink haired girl, named Maya, somehow makes her way through the blistering desert until she finally comes across a city. Well, it isn't long before she's confronted by a gang of five punks, and we all know what they want. Unfortunately, they get it.\n\nAfterwards, she awakes to find herself nude, blindfolded, and bound to a chair. Five men surround her, though they are different than the others. These guys are all dark gray, and all have the same lean muscular body type. They're all bald, and apparently chained to the chair that Maya is bound to. But still, they want exactly what you'd think they want, and they don't hesitate in going after Maya. But then, right in the middle of it all, Maya begins to glow, and before you know it all of the guys disappear in what looks to be scraps of gray paper, which all come together to form some kind of huge, muscular monster with five \"tentacles\" located you-know-where. And I'm sure you can guess what it does.\n\nFortunately, Maya soon wakes to realize it was just a nightmare. As if laying in a bed, not knowing how she got there, isn't confusing enough, then some dude starts pushing a little cart towards her bed while introducing himself as Halda. He looks striking similar to the white-haired guy we saw at the beginning. At any rate, he informs her that he will be taking care of her, and that she has been sold as a prostitute to this place, the city's giant tower which is a house of pleasure. And apparently, she was sold for more money than any other prostitute had ever been sold for in the tower. Bet she feels proud! I don't know if she resisted at first or what, but after a quick montage of still frames, she seems to have embraced the lifestyle.\n\nThen, one day, a client enters her room... and he knows her name. It's Chaos, the white-haired dude from the beginning! Hah! I tricked you! I made you think her servant guy was that dude, but nope! But to be fair, they do look alike. Well, he has a grudge against her for some reason. Of course, that doesn't stop him from having his fun. While he does, he tells her about how there are no young women in the city, and that nobody seems to care. On top of that, apparently nobody has ever seen the master of the tower. The tower holds a secret, he feels.\n\nAh, but Maya soon will, for once each month every woman in the tower has the honor and privilege of being pleasured by Lord Bazus. Inside his chamber there are women everywhere, being pleasured by each other and what looks to be mechanical tentacles. Shocking? Most definitely, but not more than Bazus himself, who looks strikingly similar to the monster in her nightmare. I'll stop here, but trust me things get even stranger. It seems she has some kind of almost magic-like essence about her that makes men go absolutely wild, and unfortunately this is never explained, which kinda just leaves you wondering in the end." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1994" ], "title" : [ "Imma Youjo - Volume I" ], "company" : [ "Pink Pineapple" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gallery/index.htm", "name" : " View Image Gallery" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_2/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume II" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_3/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume III" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_4/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume IV" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/imma_youjo_5/index.htm", "name" : "Imma Youjo - Volume V" } ], "released" : [ "1 OVA episode" ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

So Mr. Ichiro is some kind of robotics wizard, as he makes android women who are not just anatomically correct, but also have voices and personalities. And apparently he's now working on creating the perfect woman! Mu-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaaa!\nMeanwhile, we meet some creepy looking dude with an evil mustache who runs some joint which caters to men's fantasies, if you know what I mean... and we're talking about a hentai here so I'm sure you do. And of course, all the girls are androids, so they can be programmed to do whatever the guy wants. And the guys get to where this stupid looking helmet which makes them feel the pleasure that the android is feeling. A lovely invention by Mr. Ichiro.\n\nAnd speaking of Mr. Ichiro, back over at his place it seems he's finally finished his masterpiece! But instead of activating it, he leaves it in some man-sized chamber filled with a clear liquid, while he naps on his desk. But that doesn't stop his android! She awakes anyway and steps out of the chamber, revealing a beautiful and totally nude pink-haired girl. It's Maya! So that means this must be a prequel to the first volume.\n\nAnyways, it's happy days for Mr. Ichiro! Now he has a hot young lady to run around and frolic with, and that's exactly what he does. This being a hentai you'd kind of expect him to go straight for the sex first, but nope, this guy is a real gentleman with his Maya. Oh, but don't worry, the sex does come eventually. You knew it would, he just had to actually make sure she fell in love with him first. Yeah, apparently this android can do that!

Seems like your typical, optimistic male middle school student. He's a member of the kendo club, though his kendo skills leave a lot to be desired. And that's a bit of a problem, because a girl he has a crush on is more interested in the guy who wins. But what \n lakes in talent he makes up for in determination. And that's what makes \n different from any other kid his age... cause his determination stronger than freakin' adamantium. But lets not jump ahead, as we'll be getting to that later.\nSo on his way home after kendo practice, \n decides to detour over to an old hangout that he and his friends used to play around at. Three huge smokestacks is what stands out among the area, which \n and his friends would climb to prove how brave they were. Only \n made it to the top every time. This time, however, he spies a blue haired girl about his age already sitting atop one of the smokestacks. Funny thing is, the ladder on that smokestack appears to be busted. So he climbs up an adjacent tower and attempts to make conversation with the extremely quiet girl, who seems only to want to sit and enjoy the beautiful sunset. At least \n was able to coax her name, Lala Ru, out of her.\n\nThen out of nowhere appears a bunch of piloted mech robots that seemed bound and determined to capture this sweet young girl. Lala Ru doesn't put up much resistance, but she does mouth something to \n... just a simple, non-emotional request for help. But that's all it took to get \n to spring into action, risking his life high atop the smokestacks to stop these people from and their mechs from abduction Lala Ru. This is really where we start to catch a glimpse of \n's unmatched determination. Out-numbered? Doesn't matter. Out-gunned? Doesn't matter. He ever persists after the towers begin to crumble! Unfortunately, the poor lad fails, and one of the mech suits tosses \n up into the air. The next thing you know a big energy bubble surrounds them all and poof, their gone.\n\nEverything caught inside that energy sphere re-materializes inside a giant chamber, and I mean everything, including rubble from the collapsing towers. Without skipping a beat, \n finds Lala Ru and takes off! The leader of the team attempting to capture Lala Ru, a woman named Abelia, orders the heavy metal doors to be shut, but \n and Lala Ru slip though just in time, giving them even more of a head start. They don't get far, however, before they finds themselves in the middle of a drawbridge that is being raised. They are on opposite sides, so \n reaches out, but Lala Ru won't jump. And so the young boy with a heart of gold makes the decision to leap across the ever expanding gap back to where Lala Ru is. Flying through the air, he reaches out as far as his arms will allow, yet all he is able to grab is Lala Ru's pendant before he starts plummeting to the depths below.\n\nThis scene is very reminiscent of another scene in a PlayStation 2 game called Ico. And the next scene is reminiscent of that one in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back where Luke is falling after being beaten by Vader and ends up sliding through giant tubes which slow his decent. Somehow, in real life I just don't think it would happen like that. But this is anime, so its all good. So now Lala Ru is back in the hands of her would-be abductors, and \n is alone, running for his life aboard what seems to be some kind of giant complex. We soon learn that the team was after not just Lala Ru, but her pendant as well. Apparently, whatever King Hamdo's plan is, both are needed to implement it.\n\nKing Hamdo is the man in charge of everything and everyone in the massive compound. Oh, and did I mention that he's completely insane? He believes that he is the one destined to \"fix\" the world. He feels that no man is more important than the Earth, and that there will be no Earth without him, and therefor he is more important that the Earth and everybody and everything on it. Not really the kind of person you want for your leader... yet his army is completely loyal to him, especially Abelia, his right-hand woman. She follows his every order, no matter how insane it may be. This is extremely frustrating to watch, considering how intelligent and grounded she otherwise seems. There are so many times when you just want to show \"just kill him and end this madness!\", but of course if she actually did that then we wouldn't have the stupendous anime series to watch.\n\nThis is by far one of the absolute best anime series I've ever seen... ever. I blasted through all 13 episodes in one sitting, 'cause I just had to see what happened next. And what's great is that each episode had meaning behind it; there were no throw away episodes. The art style, although nothing ground breaking, was still quite good and definitely powerful enough to allow the dredging up of emotions throughout the grim tale. Of course, the voice actors help with that as well, especially the voice for King Hamdo. Both the Japanese and English voice actors were able to stunningly capture this madman. I should definitely mention here that this anime is definitely not for children, as there is a lot of violence and deals with several really tough subjects. I don't think it's rated by the \n, but if it was I'm sure it would have gotten an R rating.\nThe portion of the saga that I described above takes place in the first couple of episodes, and there is really a lot more here than just the standard boy-with-girl-and-her-pendant story. There is a lot of emotion is this series, due in part to some of the hard issues explored within, such as slavery, rape, and child abuse.

The heroic Iczer 1 fights with all her might to stop the devilish Neos Gold from spreading her evil. Iczer 1 accomplishes her task, but not before an entire planet gets blown apart by Neos Gold, and also not before using up the last of her energy. Still, Neos Gold is halted, though not destroyed. Neither combatant has the strength to continue. Each must recover before this war will eventually be decided, yet the malicious Neos Gold has already selected the battlefield for their next conflict... Earth! In preparation for the showdown, the evil one sends her four female generals, Fiber, Golem, Insecto, and Bigro, to devastate its surface. Seems like the fun will never end!\nNagisa and Shizuka are both part-timers at a military moon base when the invasion begins, and both girls seem to be about high school age. Nagisa awakes from a nightmare, knowing that something is wrong. They quickly learn from Yajin, another part-timer at the base, that they've lost contact with one of their ships out in space. Soon, the terror reaches Earth, and one by one they witness the other bases being taken out. Its not long before the rampage infests their location as well, but with the hanger destroyed, escape seems impossible. The two young ladies cower in a corner, unsure of their next move.\n\nThen Yajin arrives with hope for survival! He leads them to the construction bay housing a nearly completed space ship, the Queen Fuji. There they meet up with two other base personal, who are ready to get the heck out of there! Unfortunately, before they even get a chance to climb aboard their last remaining hope for escape and blast off, Nagisa finds herself being grabbed and hung upside-down by what appears to be a claw floating in mid-air. A horde of minions de-cloak to reveal that the sole survivors of the base are completely surrounded by giant metallic warrior beasts. Truly, all hope seems to be lost, but just as one of the beasts is about to strike with its razor sharp claws, it gets blown back by some unexpected force. It's \n, and she's ready to play!\n is Iczer 1's little sister. Like Iczer 1, she was created by Sister Grey. Though \n had not yet fully matured, the unfortunate circumstances left Sister Grey little choice but to send the young super-being to Earth. She arrived to late to stop all the destruction, but once she appeared in the construction bay, \n had no problem teaching those mechanical monsters who the boss was. Fiber was shocked to see another being with powers that matched Iczer 1's, but that didn't stop her from trying to take the lass out. Too bad for her that it didn't go so well, 'cause Neos Gold doesn't take kindly to failure. Fiber may have been defeated by \n, but her destruction came from the wicked one.\n\nOnce settled in, the troop heads out in their new ship to scour the Earth for survivors. Their first search mission outside the ship takes them into a swarm of odd-looking insects, similar to those that were seen destroying some of the other bases. The only one who didn't fear these creatures was \n, who ran around outside playing with them as they unsuccessfully tried to eat her. Unfortunately, the search party struck out on finding anything living other than the bugs, so they returned to the saftey of the ship... or so they thought. Once the little buggers make their way inside the ship, \n takes off to battle Insecto, the woman controlling the pests. Being the self-proclaimed greatest warrior of the four generals, Insecto puts up a valiant fight, though it still doesn't last too much longer than Fiber did... at least, not in her first form.\n\nHer second form is giant, like Godzilla size, so \n goes and grabs Nagisa, claiming that she needs Nagisa's help for this. Pretty much everyone is puzzled at this point, but then \n creates a giant robot out of thin air, and merges herself and Nagisa to it. And of course, for some reason Nagisa has to be naked and floating in some kind of liquid in order to help control this Iczer-Robo. Don't worry though, all her naughty bits are conveniently covered up. As soon as Iczer-Robo finishes off the enormous Insecto, a new battle immediately begins , this time against a holographic Neos Gold. Iczer-Robo expends all it's energy trying to conquer this hologram, allowing it to steal Iczer-Robo's Iczerian power. And don't ask me how a hologram could steal anything, 'cause I didn't understand that either.\nThe strain of controlling Iczer-Robo put Nagisa, unconscious, in the medical bay, while Yajin throws \n in the brig for what she did to Nagisa. All the while, Neos Gold is using her stolen Iczerian power to create Atlas, an \n of her own! What's going to happen with \n goes up a foe who equates to her twin sister? Will the crew of the Queen Fuji be able to track down anyone who survived the vicious attack on their planet, or are they the lone survivors? Will Iczer 1 heal in time to resist the evil Neos Gold, or will \n have to go it alone?

We see her tounge and nipples are pierced with hooks attached to thin threads, pulling at her bits. Then we see she is in a giant spiderweb of threads, and with he is another completely nude women who apparently represents the spider in this little sex game. Miss spider is a busty pink-haired woman body-painted up in all white, except for the occasional black stripes. This isn't just a private moment between two ladies, however. This is entertainment for a crowd of ladies and gents, all who look quite wealthy, and all who also sport masks of some sort.\nInter-cut with this spectacle of exhibitionism is Maya, the seemingly only constant of this entire series. And even she doesn't remain constant. For this episode, she is a dark-haired beauty who is starting her first day as a maid at a luxurious mansion. Tomoka, the resident maid, doesn't appear to care for Maya's arrival, but shows her the ins and outs nonetheless. The only time she acts friendly toward Maya is that night, as she hands Maya a mug of warm milk, and I'm sure you can guess why.\n\nOnce the milk turns out Maya's lights, Tomoka heads for the one room she told Maya never to enter without Master's permission. And once again, I'm sure you can guess what happens there. She begins to get all hot and bothered, then looses her clothes, and so on and so forth. The next day, Maya meets Master's son, Masao... and lets just say that this guy appears to have some issues that need working out. So that night Tomoka goes through the same routine as before, only this time the cup blows off the nightstand and wakes Maya up. She wanders down to the forbidden room where she hears strange noises, and as she peeks inside she sees Tomoka all tied up with some red rope, with Master and his driver/bodyguard, Hawiwara, having their way with her.\n\nBefore she overhears their entire conversation, she passes out and is found by Masao, who carries her back to her room. Then begins the trickery. Master has Tomoka intentionally break a \"valuable\" vase using a string when Maya is the only one in the room so that they can blame her for it. Thus they get to to say that she'll do anything to make up for it, at which point her home becomes the forbidden room, and her uniform becomes her birthday suit. Her training begins with the watching of Tomoka pleasuring Master to see how it's done. That's followed up by Tomoka pleasuring the still restrained Maya. And after that... well, I'll just let you watch to find that out.\n\nEventually, it becomes time for Tomoka's \"debut\", whatever that is supposed to mean. Fortunately, it doesn't take long to find out. Tomoka is going to entertain the audience we saw in the opening scene. But she doesn't have a mask and isn't painted up like a spider. She has on gloves, stockings, one rose in each hand, one in her mouth, and one in an area that I will avoid mentioning. As she begins her erotic dance, when start to intercut with Maya, who is now in the presence of Masao. He's there to rescue her, but she instantly goes for his pants, unzipping his fly and... well, I'm sure you can figure it out from there. Masao, not surprisingly, puts up no resistance to her feminine advances. Guess rescue will have to wait!\n\nBack at the exhibition, two new entries from a different collector join in on Tomoka's parade. They are a big, blond-haired muscle man and a petite bond-haired nymphomaniac. Apparently the name of the game is whomever orgasams first looses, and although Tomoka puts up a good effort, she eventually succumbs to the tag team effort of the blond beauties. Needless to say, Master isn't happy about this at all, and vows to get Maya ready to debut for the next exhibition. Of course, those who have watched the previous installments in the series pretty much know what's going to happen from here on out.

This resulted in what fans dub as the \"infamous island episodes\" (Eps. 23-34). With the exception of one episode (Ep. 31, \"Farewell, Red Noah\"), these filler episodes suffer from poor animation quality (mainly because Gainax subcontracted other animated studios in Japan and Korea) and scripting that not only throws the show off course, but messes up character development, wastes time, and breaks the more somber, serious (if occasionally comic) tone that propels the story for the first twenty-two episodes and the showclosing five.\nAs it that wasn't bad enough, NHK Enterprises decided, shortly after the series ended, to produce a feature-length movie, with no involvement from the creative team who originally worked on the show. Approximately thirty minutes of the 90-minute film were clips recycled from the show. Given how the show ends, the call for a movie was wholly unnecessary.

It is \n weird.\nThe story of Fooly Cooly revolves around a small group of people living together in a slightly off-kilter city. There is 12-year-old \n, practically alone in the world with an otaku father and a brother currently in the states playing baseball. There is also \n, the 17-year-old girlfriend of his brother, who seems to be paying a lot of attention to \n himself lately.\nThen the weird stuff begins when \n drops in, runs him over with a Vespa scooter, kisses him, and bashes him in the head with a bass guitar (oh, and he survived all that), and now strange things are coming out of his head...\n!. And this is just the first episode. Imagine five more episodes where things just get even wilder. And yet, every now and then, there is just the right dose of sanity to make this a short but sweet series.\nIn addition to its over-the-top weirdness, FLCL is loaded with self-reference, subtle elements, self-parody, a few degrees of tastelessness, and a story of coming of age in a place where the people who should care about you don't and those who shouldn't do. Oh, did I forget to mention the rock soundtrack that pervades the series' background music?\nIncidentally, the term \"Furi Kuri\" is Tokyo slang, meaning to feel someone up in a provocative way. Also, the bass guitar in the series looks to be a Rickenbacker, called \"Ricks\" for short.", "When I first saw Fooly Cooly, I was hooked. It has a great look and is hilarious, although quite confusing. I guess it is supposed to be set in the present day or something. Anyway it's about a boy who has an ordinary, boring life. He is constantly talking about his brother who is away in the U.S playing baseball (hence the fact he is always carrying a bat).\nThen this girl hits him with her Vespa scooter. Now this girl and a robot are living with him and he's sprouting horns from his head which wind up turning to robots. His robot friend then eats him and fights the bad robots. (The robot craps him out afterward.) And it all has to do with a gigantic mysterious factory in his town.", "FLCL is a story about a kid named \n. He is a grammar school student who's brother is off playing baseball in America. His brother's girlfriend, \n, starts to take a liking to him. Then, he suddenly gets hit by a mysterious girl named \n on a Vespa that is incredibly fast. When he comes to, she hits him with her bass guitar, and wonders why there is nothing coming out of her head. She leaves, and we see \n trying to fix the bump in his head, but instead of a little bump, it's a horn. \n goes to the hospital where \n had snuck in. She pronounces it as the disease FLCL, and trys to finish the job by hitting him on the head again with her guitar.\nLater on at night he starts having spasms, and two robots come out of his head and start dueling. One of them looks like a walking television, while the other is a hand. The walking television wins, and then \n hits \n with her guitar, which causes him to lose his memory. \n is then hired by \n's father, and the robot is brought home as well.\nThe whole story is about Medical Mechanica, a large corporation with a giant iron as a factory, trying to destroy \n and take over the world.

The show came from Japan, where it began as a famous 1950s children's comic-art novel, Jungulu Taitei [King of the Jungle] by Osamu Tesuka, who was already popular for his \n character.\nThe TV Kimba is a simplification of the novel. Big-game hunters kill the mighty Caesar, king of the jungle, and capture his queen, Snowene. Kimba is born on the boat that brings his mother to a zoo in Europe, but he escapes, and he returns to the African veld. Caesar's old friends, led by wise old Dan'l Baboon, Bucky Deer, and Pauley Cracker the parrot, try to help Kimba realize his place as the young Prince, but Kimba wants to be more than a strong fighter like father. He is impressed by human civilization and he wants to create a similar animal civilization where beasts will not have to prey on each other. This stirs the opposition of many animals. Even the friendlier carnivores point out that he is basically asking them to starve to death.\n\nDespite the serious tone of the story, the 52 episodes that were syndicated in America in 1966 were kept light and humorous, and were designed to be seen in random sequence. But the Japanese public familiar with the cartoon-art classic had some awareness of the chronology of the TV episodes.\nKimba begins as a babyish cub, acknowledged as the Prince but considered an impractical dreamer by all but his closest friends. Gradually, he accomplishes his goals (including finding a \"Meat substitute\" for the carnivores) and convinces the other animals of the value of his \"civilization.\" By the last episodes, he is a husky teenager and his peaceful animal kingdom is solidly established.\nKimba was a Japanese cartoon, but the name is American.

Set approximately 300 years from now, we learn that teenagers are all pretty much the same. Sure, they might be living inside giant space colonies on the moon since the earth is supposedly uninhabitable, but like many a teenager, Takeru longs for more freedom than society allows. But since he doesn't know how to go about getting said freedom, he instead tries to soup up his car-like racing vehicle so that he can complete in tube races. His friends Kazuma and Bismark help him out in this task, but they can only do so much with the parts they've got.\nTakeru knows his machine still needs more work to be as fast as he needs it, yet like most teenagers his actions are influenced more by emotion than logic, so when he's goaded by racing rival Taira, the two take off on an illegal street race... even though their bracelets warned them just before they launched that curfew was about to take effect. Takeru actually manages to do pretty well, until something breaks. Caught outside after curfew standing next to their burning vehicle, Takeru and his friends end up getting community service duty.\nBut, it's not all bad. During community service, they meet an old-timer that gives the gang a rocket engine to help soup up Takeru's vehicle. Oh yeah, and while Takeru's walking outside the domes in his spacesuit, tediously checking a long patch of cable to make sure everything as it should be, he witnesses something crash not too far from him. And yes, he goes to check it out... wouldn't you, after all? What he finds is some man-made electronic wreckage, and what looks to be a piece of paper. He stands, stunned, as he reads the single question written on it, and sees the picture on the opposite side. This question and photo will surely end up changing his, if not everyone's life.\nThis anime is kind of unique, see as how it is one of the first released on a DVD/HD-DVD hybrid disc. Since I don't have any high-definition DVD player yet, much less and HD-DVD specific one, I could only watch the standard DVD part. But the cool thing is, both the DVD and the HD-DVD parts are on the same side of the disc, so the other side gets to have a label and artwork... except they decided to forgo the artwork and instead cram a whole of text which pretty much summarized most of the episode.\nThe art and animation in the anime is also different than most. It's obviously done with computers, and sections (if not all of it) are done in 3-D, even though it retains the 2-D look. If you've ever seen the cartoon \n, then you'll know what I'm talking about. It's cel-shaded like a 2D animation, but the camera movements at times show that at least some of it was modeled in 3D. I think it's a good look, and is probably where animation is headed in the future.\nWhat I don't like about this DVD release is that it contains only one episode, lasting no more than 24 minutes. With a list price of $39.99, and an Amazon price of $27.95 (at the time of this writing), that's one hell of a lot of money to put down for one volume of a six-volume series that provides less than a half hour of entertainment. Personally, there's no way I'd chuck out that much for this thing, but thankfully the good people at Bandai Visual provided me with a review copy. So yeah, I can tell you that I enjoyed this anime, it had a nice setup and I want to see what happens next... but unless you're rich with money to blow, just rent it." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct 27, 2006–May 23, 2008" ], "title" : [ "Freedom" ], "company" : [ "Sunrise", "Bandai Visual", "Freedom Committee" ], "director" : [ "Shuhei Morita" ], "released" : [ "7 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Aran" }, { "name" : "Kazuma" }, { "name" : "Bisu" }, { "name" : "Naomi" }, { "name" : "Chiyo" }, { "name" : "Taira" }, { "name" : "Gosshu" }, { "name" : "Takeru" }, { "name" : "Junk" } ], "genre" : [ "Sci-Fi" ] } }

The anime follows the manga instead of the live-action show with a more darker and introspective vision. The story revolves around \n (a.k.a \n), an android created by Dr. Komiyoji for the terrorist organization DARK, led by \n. But unknown to \n, Komyoji implanted The Gemini Circuit, which gave \n a heart and made him an amnesiac who disguises himself as a guitar playing wanderer.

There she finds out a horrifying secret: \n had an older brother, who died during the creation of \n and her mother (who left the family when she was young) was actually a spy for \n, sent to observe and collect data on Komyoji as his wife; even going as far as giving birth to \n and Misaru to keep her cover! Soon, \n finds \n and fights Golden Bat while refusing to turn into \n. \n convinces \n to transform and tries to reform Golden Bat. In the end, Golden Bat sacrifices himself for \n after one of his traps inadvertently fires at her. But before he said good-bye, he reveals that the blueprints are inside \n's guitar but was shot by a leather-clad biker with a yellow scarf. That biker is \n a.k.a \n, \n's evil \"younger brother\".\n and company then find Mrs. Komiyoji, who has turned cruel and bitter towards \n. She is then ordered to kill \n and friends with a robot.

Mrs. Komiyoji considers the evils she has done in life and commits suicide in front of her kids. Meanwhile, \n tries to fight \n's influence while causing mayhem in town. He retreats to an old junk pile, where \n confronts him in a very intimate moment. He rids himself of \n's command and fights him. \n transforms into \n and reveals his trump card: inside \n's head lies the disembodied brain of Dr. Komiyoji and destroying \n kills the brain. Losing the fight, the gang goes after \n who proceeds to beat \n and shoots off his arm. Suddenly, the brain of Komiyoji takes over \n and pleads with \n to help him against \n. He fixes his arm and then asks Hanpei to take his frozen body. They team up to fight \n and his swarm of robots, which includes an army of duplicate Hakaiders. Soon, Komiyoji loses control and \n returns, but is decapitated by the Hakaiders because \n finds him ineffective. The gang takes Komiyoji's brain and splits while \n stays to fight \n. \n was about to destroy \n, but suddenly, the headless \n starts choking \n and killing him. The base is destroyed, leaving \n to think \n is dead.

Her father has recently returned from New Guinea. He has returned with a relic from that country. The relic has two jewels on it that Natsumi turns into earrings. That evening, she has a dream and meets the god Ahem. Ahem tells Natsumi that the god of destruction, Ongo, is about to return to this world. Ahem gives her a magic necklace with skulls on it. Naturally, Natsumi is repulsed by this. He does a dance that seems inspired by epileptic convulsions, and tells Natsumi to do the same dance when she's in trouble. When she wakes up, she finds she has the necklace on, and she's in New Guinea. Ongo is next to her, only instead of a menacing brute, he's a cute little boy. One that doesn't know about Japan.\nLater on, Ongo tries some whale meat, and then summons a whale because he wants more. Unfortunately, he summons a good chunk of ocean water with him. Now floating down a torrent of water and the street, the military attacks. Ongo tells Natsumi to use the necklace, and she refuses initially. When she does the dance, she becomes Mii, the flower spirit. Natsumi becomes a grown woman with a very large chest and jungle attire. She stops the military from attacking by dancing and causing flower petals to form.\nThe next day, Natsumi is walking to school. There's a photo of Mii in the paper. Natsumi, in a fit of anger, throws Takuma into Nami. In the nurse's office, Nami relates how she wants to use New Guinea magic. Natsumi takes her to an exhibition that her father is planning, and Takuma follows. While examining a statue of the spirit of water, Rongo, Nami gets engulfed in water. The next day in school, Nami hits on Natsumi, wanting Ongo. She then tries to remove the skull pendant that Ahem gave her, and it gives them both a nasty electric shock. After doing a sex inspired dance, Nami becomes Rongo, and shoots out a lot of water, soaking everyone in the process. Rongo wants Ongo back, but he can't remember her. Rongo challenges Natsumi for Ongo's affections, and will return Nami if she wins. With a bit of help from Ongo, Mii wins.\nNext they go back to the exhibition again. Ongo hears voices in his head, and becomes Ongo the destroyer. He goes on a rampage, leaving a swath of destruction wherever he goes. Ahem appears and tells Mii she must dance to trap Ongo the destroyer. After doing her dance, she grows to the gigantic size of Ongo. Mii, with the help of Ahem, defeats the destroyer.\nEcchi rating is for numerous suggestive themes, especially Nami's transformation into Rongo, and Ahem's codpiece." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2001" ], "creator" : [ "Yugi Moriama" ], "company" : [ "AnimeWorks" ], "title" : [ "Jungre de Ikou" ], "director" : [ "Yugi Moriama" ], "released" : [ "3 OVA episodes" ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Comedy", "Ecchi", "Paranormal" ] } }

Luckily for us, he accidentally wishes \n back to his younger self. Unfortunately, Pilaf was using the black star Dragon Balls (suspected to be created by Piccolo Diamoh). If the black star Dragon Balls are not reunited in one year the earth explodes. Getting even worse, instead of spreading around the world like normal Dragon Balls, the black star Dragon Balls spread around the galaxy. It is decided that \n and \n would then go around the galaxy searching for them. Unfortunately, \n becomes a stowaway.\nDragon Ball GT is separated into two sagas, the Bebi Saga, and the Evil Shenlon Saga. During the Bebi Saga, \n, \n, and \n run into a robot named \n who eats the Dragon Radar, but by eating it he now has the ability to find Dragon Balls. The trio has no choice but to bring him along. Soon they meet a professor (Dr. Miyu) who is also searching for the Dragon Balls. Unfortunately he is killed by Bebi, the last of an ancient race of aliens known as Truffles (Tsufurujin in Japanese), but Bebi is eventually defeated by \n in Super Saiyajin 4 mode.\nThe Evil Shenlon Saga is where Dr. Miyu and Dr. Gero Team up.

Each Dragon Ball released an evil Shenlon, which \n and his friends eventually defeated. Shenlon then announced that it was time for \n to go with him. After a quick tour of the world, \n and Shenlon disappear, forever. The series is ended off with a TV special starring \n's great great grandson, \n.\nNote: The US version has one addition recap episode that the Japanese version didn't have, because the first 16 episodes weren't aired at first so they needed an episode to sum up the story thus far.

series. \n now has a son named \n, after his grandfather. All of a sudden, a mysterious guy named \n comes form outer space. He tells \n that he is his brother and that they are Saiyajins, a race of warriors who take over planets. He hits \n and takes \n. \n has to go get his old enemy, \n, to help him defeat \n. They both fight \n, and \n sacrifices himself to kill him. \n uses a makankosappo (Special Beam Cannon) to drill through both. In his dying breath, \n tells \n that two more powerful Saiyajins, \n and \n, are coming to earth in a year. \n, in heaven (or whatever you wanna call it), has to run across a 1,000,000 mile road that will take him to Kaio-sama, the ultimate martial arts teacher. \n kidnaps \n so that he can train him.\n gets together \n, Tenshinhan, \n, and Chauzu to train. \n just sits and eats. Over the year that passes, \n learns Kaioken and the Genki Dama, the Z senshi's skills improve, and \n's heart is sofened by love (paternal) for \n. After a year, the Saiyajins arrive. \n, Tenshinhan, \n, and Chauzu die in the initial fight with \n. (\n is killed by a Sabai man who self destructs, \n is killed by \n as he saved \n, Chauzu self destructs to kill \n, and Tenshinhan drains all his energy to try to kill \n) \n finally arrives (\n wished him back with the Dragon Balls), sees how almost all of his friends were killed, and kicks \n's arse. \n then kills \n for being stupid and weak.\n fought \n for a long time with \n demonstrating the Kaio techs, before he finally gets up to Kaioken 3. In this state, he is a match for \n. However, \n turns into an Oozaru (were-monkey) by making a small moon. He beats the crap out of \n and is almost unstoppable. Luckily, \n happens to finally be around to cut off his tail with his sword. \n still fights though,and beats up \n. However, \n has also seen the light of the mini moon, and turns into an Oozaru himself. The weakened \n notices this, and quickly shoots off \n's tail. But as \n reverts, he falls on \n, almost killing him. \n wants to finish him off, but \n stops him because he always likes a challenge, and \n was leaving the planet anyway. Now they must go back to \n's home \n(Namek) to restore Piccolo so that the Earth Dragon Balls will be brought back on line, so they can bring back their friends (phew!)...\nBesides the TV seasons, there are also thirteen main movies, and two TV Specials:", "Now, \n, \n, and \n (oh yeah, \n too) take off to Namek to use the dragonballs on that planet to revive \n so that the earth Dragonballs will come back (phew!). \n (nerd) finds the remains of \n's ship but it blows up or something. Fourtunately, they find \n's ship that he originally used to come to earth. \n is still hurt from the fight with \n, so he is resting.\n, \n, and \n go to Namek, but \n (evil guy) decides that he wants the Dragonballs to become immortal. Meanwhile, \n is destroying villages trying to get dragonballs so that HE may become immortal. This leads to alot of fighting between \n's minions, the Z warriors (\n and \n), and \n. \n is starting to turn into a good guy, even though he doesn't really notice it. He also heard of the legend of a \"Super Saiyajin\", and thinks that it will turn out to be him. They end up getting the balls (which give them 3 wishes).\nThey bring \n back, he fuses with Nail annd becomes more powerful. \n and \n are mad about not being able to get a wish until they find out that there are more wishes. Anyway, \n is finally ready to fight, he beats up people, \n comes in the nick of time, gets mad when \n kills \n, and goes Super Saiyajin (hair turns gold). \n now lets loose energy into the planet's core so that the planet will explode in a matter of time.\nMeanwhile, Kaio-sama, \n, and \n are using the combination of Super Shenron and \n to revive all the people on Namek, and then teleport them to Earth. Meanwhile (there was alot of that going on), \n kicks \n's arse. \n manages to escape the planet before it blows up. But...\nThe battle isn't over yet. \n's father, \n, finds \n's body parts and puts him back together with robotic parts. They go to earth to kill everybody and the Z-Warriors can't do a thing to stop them. However a mysterious guy named \n comes in wearing a capsule corp jacket. He nicely disposes of the two (by the way, he also can go super saiyajin), cutting \n in half. He warns \n and friends of androids created by Dr. Gero that will come in the near future, and gives \n some heart medicine. This leads to the android saga...", "In this saga, \n warns \n about the two androids (I get confused here) that killed every body and messed up his future. He gives \n the heart medicine. \n and the others go to train for the coming androids. During this time, \n has sex with \n. The androids (19 and 20) come to fight the heroes. They have come to get revenge on \n for destroying the Red Ribbon during the Dragon Ball series. The fight starts, and \n is out of it because he didn't take his heart medicine. Everybody basically gets beat up because the androids can suck energy, and never get tired. We learn that \n can go Super-Saiyajin now, and he takes on the droids. He kills number 19. 20 escapes to fight another day. (I'll fill in this part when I review the eps)\nNow there are two more androids (\n and \n) on the loose. 20 (Dr.Gero) keeps ordering them around, but they don't like it. He tells them about \n which is a failure. \n kills Dr. Gero and activates \n. \n figures that he needs to power up to and goes with \n. \n, \n, \n, and \n go to the room of space and time so they can go beyond Super Saiyajin.

Examples of this would be element mages or possession mages. Holder-Type magic needs an item to work. Examples of this are Celestial Spirits mages and Requip mages. There are also mages called Dragon Slayers, and these are mages whose bodies are given the characteristics of dragons, allowing them to strengthen their physical attacks with their element and to eat their element to become stronger or heal themselves, though they cannot eat the attacks they create.

Then those 100 kids have a 100 kids of their own, and so on. Of course if this continues several generations, you have a horrible population problem. So the people of the future decide to go back in time and change the DNA of this guy. It was supposed to be quite simple- a DNA operator goes back in time and shoots \n with a DCM bullet that will alter and change his DNA, then the operator returns to the less populated future. However those masterminds that devised this great plan, made one mistake... putting Karin Aoi in charge of the operation.\nSo Karin goes back in time and makes one very serious mistake... she brings the wrong DCM bullet (hey we all do it at one time or another). So when she finally confronts \n she shoots him with a bullet that increases the possibility of him becoming the \"Mega-Playboy\". OH NO!!! This is horrible... \n will most likely cause the horrible population increase. And even worse, because of the bullet \n's DNA is super unstable which causes him to change between the super mega playboy, and his regular boring self at anytime. He briefly changes once, resulting in Saeki (a main character) to fall in love with him. Every girl in the world is attracted to \n when he turns into the mega playboy. Every girl but Ami, \n's \"friend\" since childhood. Oh boy... confused yet??? Well me too...\nKarin, seeing her mission failing in front of her eyes, comes up with a plan (one that might allow her to still get that \"sweet sweet home, and great husband\"). The plan is to get Ami and \n together. Since Ami isn't turned on by \n when he is the mega playboy, \n will never have the impulse to change. The plan seems great, but \n is not in love with Ami (well if you think about you might say he is); he is more in love with Karin. Karin's plan is harder and harder to achieve. Finally Karin receives the correct DCM bullet from the future! Karin will now be able to get the mission over with. Well, of course it doesn't turn out to be that easy (sounding kinda familiar doesn't it)... The reason: SHE SHOOTS THE WRONG PERSON!!! She actually shoots Ryuji (in fact he's a big jerk). Well this causes a problem (yep, you guessed it), for now Ryuji turns into this big dictator type of person!\nNow \n, Karin and Ami have to team up and exterminate Ryuji. It's a fierce little competition, but of course the good guys come through. Now that the Ryuji incident is over, they all have to decide on what's gonna happen. That's when outta the blue, a new time machine comes from the future.

This little girl has always been around when trouble is about. \n, followed by \n, jumps into the car and floors it. They catch up the abandoned bike at a castle on top of the ridge road. Of course they go in.\n\n\n welcomes \n and \n to their \"farewell\" party, to which \n and \n laugh, that is until \n mistakenly insults not just \n, but also \n (this is not wise!). As \n and \n skilfully evade the various attacks on them, they reduce \n's arsenal down to her Tedybear, Mack, and Papa Mack. Even this doesn't stand up to a close assault. (If you are actually stupid enough to insult our lovely \n, don't do it when she still has her powersword!)\nAnother case of wrong doing is finally raped up, as \n administers appropriate punishment on \n. Shame that the fairy tale castle didn't fair very well. It will also be a long time before the Pink Sniper decides to cross paths with \n and \n, they're just too dangerous.", "It would not normally be considered that either \n or \n were particularly sporty. Yes, \n constantly practices her combat skills, while \n stays in shape for much more feminine reasons, but volley ball championships?\n and \n have been selected for a special mission. A way has been found for the 3WA to arrest the president of a powerful corporation known as the \"Northern Concern\", wanted on a string of charges. \n and \n will, however, have to undergo several weeks of intensive training, far above the current skills. Our girls are therefore transferred to the corps special training facility, where they are assigned to \n, the hardest of all the corps instructors.\nFor the next few weeks \n and \n are pushed beyond their known limits, so far in fact that they become walking zombies. Eventually \n cracks and is unable to take it any more, after all this training has wrecked her and she hasn't been able to wash her hair properly (not good for such a long and beautiful Maine). \n breaks down into tears and threatens to quit. \n, now getting very used to \n through all their missions to date, supports \n and the two leave. However, the instructor has an ace up his sleeve and persuades them to make it through. Soon \n and \n are molded into a team, tighter than anything before them and able to withstand ten times the punishment of before. Finally, the Lovely Angels pass the last test with flying colours. They are now ready for their mission.\nAs the ball goes up, it is launched with the force of a bazooka. The Galactic Volleyball Championships are under way. The competition is very good, but not good enough as the barrage onslaught from \n and \n continues. Soon the ball goes down for the last point. The unknown outsiders are the new Galactic Champions (wow). To present them with their trophy, the president appears. At this point our girls spring into official action and arrest the president, with a \"small\" amount of backup.\nBack at headquarters, \n is very pleased with their action, but lets slip a piece of information the girls were mislead on. Now the corps special instructors will learn a lesson- Don't lie to the Dirty Pair!", "This is not actually from \n and \n's official case files, but was a small mission \n \"volunteered\" to embark on to Help \n out of a small jam that she had got herself into. Without giving the story away, there's not a lot to this story.\n has to volunteer to baby sit Julian (the grandson of a weathly business man named Mr. Winston), who believes \n to be the perfect woman (easy to do!-biased!-sorry). Anyway, \n has to spend the next week with Julian in rather unusual conditions, with almost ridiculous constraints. Fortunately, \n feels she is in \n's debt and \n ensures that \n is going to repay her. Points to note, while \n goes through many attractive outfits, do you recognise one particular outfit? Also, \n makes a very cute pizza delivery girl, just don't short change her.\nEventually \n decides that she must straighten Julian's thinking about women, and explain to him what real women are all about. This revelation has unexpected results. As with any Lovely Angel/Dirty Pair mission, it will never turn out as expected due to that \"luck streak\" of theirs. Poor \n! Well, Julian comes out happy, although \n doesn't quite get what she wanted, she's still got \n after all.", "The Galactic is a very rough place in parts, hence the need for an unusual, perhaps unauthordox police officer. Of course, not even the Lovely Angels get away unscathed all the time. Currently off active duty, our ladies have a few apologies to hand write- ouch!\nA little way across the galaxy, a meeting is taking place between the legendary \"Mad Dog\" Kamen and an escaped prisoner, Beringer. It would seem that Kamen has acquired a special weapon but needs Beringer's help to utilise it. Beringer agrees on one condition. He wants a 100 hours with the weapon to settle an old debt with the 3WA and a man named \n. Time to cut back to 3WA district headquarters, where \n and \n still haven't finished the apologies. While down in the basement, a surprise is entering the building, pretty risky huh?\nUnfortunately, the building defences seem to be designed to stop terrorists and humanoid invaders, not super heavy combat tanks! As Beringer cuts through the headquarters, \n becomes isolated, while \n and \n naturally stop off at the armory. \n and \n catch up with \n as most of the building's staff are evacuated to safety. Things are not going well for the home team as it transpires that they just haven't got enough serious firepower, (me thinks \n will procure some better \"supplies\" after this event), however \n has what is considered a real \"think on your feet\" moment. The worst news is that Beringer has captured little Rosa and is quite happy to use her to get to \n. As \n heads towards the roof after Beringer and Rosa, with \n in pursuit, \n heads down to the basement to find the only thing she can think of that has enough power to punch through Beringer's super armour. As with anything \n does, the word overkill jump into mind.\nUp on the roof things are now getting rather taught, as Beringer plays with \n, wanting to savor the moment. However, his time is up and Kamen wants his toy back. Beringer must now get rid of \n, discarding little Rosa, he trains his attention on \n. \n gives \n the command to fire and \n always hits her target. Unfortunately (a favorite Dirty Pair word!), \n hits more than her intended target, but then I think \n forgot to tell \n what had moved above them.\nIn the end, \n can't help but to thank our heroines, even if he must now help them write another load of apologies. Still, a good score for the Lovely Angels record! Not only did they take out Beringer and destroy the stolen mech, they managed to get \"Mad Dog\" Kamen in the process as well!\nOverall scores were several thousand for the good guys, complete toast for the bad guys, and for everyone else, heavy collateral damage with mixed casualties and a serious taste of what's to come now that the Dirty Pair have come of age!" ], "jp_info" : { "creator" : [ "Haruka Takechiho" ], "company" : [ "Studio NUE", "Sunrise" ], "title" : [ "Dirty Pair Flash: Mission 3" ], "released" : [ "5 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/dirty_pair_flash/poporo.htm", "name" : "Chief Poporo" }, { "name" : "\"Mad Dog\" Kamen" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/dirty_pair_flash/gazelle.htm", "name" : "Gazelle" }, { "name" : "Beringer" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/dirty_pair_flash/kei.htm", "name" : "Kei" }, { "name" : "Julian" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/dirty_pair_flash/monica.htm", "name" : "Monica De Noir" }, { "name" : "Mr. Winston" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/dirty_pair_flash/yuri.htm", "name" : "Yuri" }, { "name" : "Rosa" } ] } }

Kobayashi has a very short attention span, and is always harping about her weight (50 kg; 110 lbs.) Nakamura is nicknamed \"old man\" because not only does he look older than he is, he acts that way as well. Seki is the classical narcissist, who isn't above cross-dressing. Iincho wants to be class president because her favorite singer said he liked class presidents. Watabe aspires to be the world's greatest artist; he's the only member of the manga club. Kudo, a gay pervert, loves Suetake (but not vice versa) and has the title of \"nosebleed king.\" Tominaga is in the cooking club, likes horror films and generally has to put guys in their place. Kitagawa has a thing for short women, and naturally, likes Mika. Suetake is the jock; he's in several sports clubs, but not really that bright.\nThey have the physical exam day at the school, and naturally, Kobayashi is worried about her weight. Naturally, after weighing herself, she gets very depressed. Mika has to take the exam as well, and finds out she's getting shorter. Later at the basketball championships, Mika is a backup referee. When the original ref does not show, Mika reveals she doesn't know the rules of basketball. A last-minute intervention by Mika's doting father saves the day. Kitagawa cheers for her. After watching volleyball, they watch the baseball game. Seki encourages the others to cheer by dressing up in a cheerleader's outfit and giving the girls pom-poms. Mika's class ends up winning.\nOn the first day of summer, Seki comes in dressed as a Japanese schoolgirl. Mika collapses in the summer heat, and they take her to the school nurse Matsumoto. Then they go out for swimming. The guys admire Matsumoto in her bikini; however, Mika only gets praises from Kitagawa. After getting into the pool, Mika passes out and has to be rescued. Kitagawa offers to give her artificial respiration, despite her being able to breathe on her own.\nNext it's time to study for the exams. Here's where we find out Mika may not be very bright, as she encourages the kids not to be cunning instead of not cheating. Oddly enough, the only student that passed the exams was resident baka jock Suetake.\nDuring summer break, Mika's dad takes her to a shopping arcade, where she meets all her students. He thinks Seki is a girl until Mika sets him straight; however, this doesn't sit too well with him. Then at the summer festival, Mika and her students meet up. Seki shows up in a yukata (a traditional Japanese female summer kimono.) To spot her in the crowd, her students tie a bunch of balloons to Mika. She ends up floating into the air.

Still, the girls get to play with some nice large dump trucks, and naturally capture their prey. So our girls get both their man and their meal.\n has still not been able to track the virus entry point, but is closing in on the source. The group has now been found some better accommodations, but this still does not suit our girls until they do a little rearranging of their own (poor \n).\nFor the next few days, \n's efforts are distracted by a beautiful young lady named \n. \n tries his best to impress \n and even asks \n for her advice. \n shows \n that he should not be afraid and arranges a date for \n. Things naturally take an unexpected turn. This affair almost kills \n with laughter. \n, however, is both shocked and then very pleased for several reasons.\n finally tracks down the source of the virus to JAIC. However JAIC needs to escape off planet and heads for the spaceport, due to be reopened within the hour, after two weeks. \n identifies JAIC at the spaceport, and \n and \n go into pursuit, only to see JAIC steal the Lovely Angel itself.\n, of course, goes completely insane over this (or should that be ballistic!). \n meantime has the brilliant idea of hijacking an incoming transport to block the Lovely Angel (they cannot let JAIC escape). This maneuver surprisingly works. Since we are talking the Dirty Pair here, there is a rather unfortunate consequence for \"World's World\".\nThe bright side of this is that after having spent two weeks really winding \n up, when \n is nearly killed \n rushes to her and even \n is surprised by this. At least the girls can quite truthfully state that they achieved all of their mission objectives, and that no criminal will ever get away from them! It's just the civilians that need to keep their heads down." ], "jp_info" : { "creator" : [ "Haruka Takechiho" ], "company" : [ "Studio NUE", "Sunrise" ], "title" : [ "Dirty Pair Flash: Mission 2" ], "released" : [ "5 OVA episodes" ] } }

During a trip to summer camp, an earthquake envelops them all, and sends them to a realm known as the Digital World. They meet creatures called Digital Monsters, creatures (some friendly, others aren't) that are capable of evolving (or Digivolving) into more powerful forms. They immediately befriend the children, becoming their partners and helping them survive the many perils of the Digital World.\nHowever, as their journey continues, they learn that the world they are trapped in isn't a game, and learn of the true reason they were sent there. The Digital World is threatened by a great evil, and the children learn of their true destiny as the Digidestined. In order to pull it off, they must realize the true potential of their Digimon and themselves. They also receive different crests of virtue to help in their mission.

The Digital World is now being terrorized by someone known as the Digimon Emperor. However, their new enemy is human, using the Digital world as a game to fuel his frustrations and ambitions.\nThe Digidestined are called back into action to put a stop to the Digimon Emperor's iron-fisted domination over the Digital World. However, new allies and Digimon join them in this new battle. But they soon learn that the Digimon Emperor is only a pawn of a new and mysterious evil threatening the Digital World. All of which will culminate in a battle that will involve the entire all of Earth....", "The third season breaks away from the story of the Digidestined and focuses on a new set of heroes in an Alternate Universe. \n is a kid who is obsessed with Digimon (which is a hit TV show and card game). One night, a Digimon known as Guilmon (\n's favorite Digimon) arrives in his world, all with the help of a mysterious Blue card.

At first sight, \n and \n must be considered an ill match at best, as they cannot agree on anything and represent a danger to themselves and others. However, the powers that be have decided that the unique talents of these two junior agents CAN be harnessed and in time they can be molded into top class Trouble Consultants. (It would appear that this is their first assignment outside their WWWA training period, and I would therefore guess that the Flash adventures take place after the Shatsi incident but before the other stories.)\nTrouble already seems to know how to find \n and \n, as it quite literally drops at \n's feet. This is very inconvenient since \n is waiting for a date. (At this point in their lives, it seems \n is purely occupied with how cute she is, while \n plans to be able to out shoot everyone!) The girls suddenly find themselves being chased by a large number of heavily armed assassins, who seem to want the data card \n now has in her possession, even though \n does not actually want it.\n\nWhile fleeing from the attackers, \n and \n manage to constantly be at each others throats. As they make their way to the safety of 3WA headquarters, our heroines manage to lay waste to a large part of the derelict suburbs of the city. With a little help from headquarters, the girls make it back with the data card. While the data card is being decrypted, \n and \n are given a simple bodyguard assignment. Unfortunately their assignment doesn't last long as their targets are taken out! \n, followed by \n, give chase to the person they believe to be the assassin, but find that, as good as the girls are (albeit inexperienced), they are totally out classed by this new adversary. (This of course really upsets \n, who is not used to being beaten!)\nBack at headquarters the assassin is identified as \n, and the girls are ordered not to pursue the matter. \n is too dangerous for junior agents to apprehend. \n is furious at being ordered not to pursue \n and storms out. In order to give \n time to cool down, \n is given another assignment.\nWhile on her own, \n manages to track the assassin on board a luxury ship, and finds her meeting with a man named \n, who she has seen before. Meanwhile, \n is informed that \n has been placed on suspension for disobeying direct orders, and \n is to bring her back for her own good.\nOn board the ship \n corners \n, who outwits her, but due to a mishap of \n's the ship goes out of control and \n's luck enables her to obtain the upper hand, leading to an unfortunate demise for \n. Unfortunately, the ship itself is also lost, but the girls manage to survive as usual.\n, still mad at \n, arrests her for the improper use of illegal weapons while on suspension. \n, outraged by \n's behavior, quits, and \n is granted a new partner, Lillie. Unfortunately, Lillie makes \n look like a dedicated agent at this point.\n is now tracking \n as a freelance operative in her usual discreet manner, with the help of some gang members she has under her thumb. Meanwhile, \n and Lillie are now also tracking \n, who has been under investigation by section 9 officers for some time. \n and Lillie are to assist in the operation to capture \n at the spaceport. However Lillie is a very pale imitation of \n and panics during the operation. All mayhem is let loose as opposing forces attempt to nail \n. As civilians dive everywhere, the spaceport is reduced to rubble. Fortunately civilian casualties are quite minimal, probably because \n is not around.\nIt is now known that \n has the override access for the galactic communications system, which he plans to use to blackmail the galaxy. Unfortunately, the ordinary galactic police are unable to stop \n. However \n has managed to stay on his tail, but as they close in, Lillie decides this is all too much for such a cute girl and abandons \n, leaving her plunging to certain death!\nJust at that moment \n appears through the thick of the fighting along with their boss (Garner) and rescues \n. \n is somewhat taken aback by \n's arrival, thinking that \n no longer cared for her.\n\nThe three of them manage to board the space station. \n and \n go round in one direction, while Garner goes round the other way. On his way around Garner comes across and old friend whom \n is to find has a secret that really surprises her.\nMeanwhile, \n and \n have found \n and are attempting to subdue him, when Garner and his friend come to assist them. After a pitch battle and a large amount of gunfire, \n is terminated and the girls have completed the case objectives, though not without casualties. The communications station, essential to this region of the galaxy, has not fared as well as the girls and is just about to explode. Therefore our adventurers make their exit just in time to catch a ring side view of the station going up into a million pieces.\nFinally back at WWWA headquarters, Garner debriefs the girls and informs them that they have now been assigned as full field agents and the code name \"Lovely Angels\" has been allocated to them, along with their own cruiser. While Garner himself closes one of his own past cases for good.\nBoth \n and \n, despite their continual disagreements, leave together having proved ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT. They cannot bare to be apart and each needs the other, even if they are unable to admit it. As they drive away, you know this is the start of a long and deep friendship that will see them through many situations.\nDuring this story, watch out for the first assignment that \n and her new partner are given and note \n's reaction to her new partners behavior. If only \n could have seen it!

At any rate, Max sees this unknown object land somewhere in the woods, and so he calls his friends out to come help him search. Max, together with Rex Owen and Zoe Drake, are known as the D-Team (can you guess what the \"D\" stands for?), and it doesn't take them long to find the point of impact, but they're shocked at what they find... stones! Not average, ordinary stones, but specifically shaped stones, with symbols on them... and a little button/knob thing. Touching the button makes them light up. Oh, and Max also finds a card that has a triceratops on it.\nWhen Max rubs the card against the stone for whatever reason, the triceratops comes out of the card and stands before them in it's giant, full-sized CGI-glory. Yeah, the dinosaurs here are done in CGI, and they don't match too well with the traditional anime-style the rest of the series follows. But I'm thinking this was probably on purpose, to make the dinosaurs stand out. As Max cowers from the giant lizard, the triceratops somehow disappears back into the card. Max then rubs the card against the stone again, but instead of a giant triceratops, a little baby one the size of a dog shows up... and it's in the traditional anime style. Max names it Chomp, because it starts biting him.\nNow that we know the heroes of the story, we are taken to meet the people who will be the villains. Doctor Z is the man in charge, a short guy with white hair and an extremely annoying voice. Along side him are the beautiful and busty Ursula and her two male lackeys, tall and slender Zander and short pudgy Ed. Together they make up the evil Alpha Gang! There are also a couple kids, Laura and Rod, but not too sure how they fit into this dysfunctional family. Oh yeah, and some blue-haird guy named Seth. Unlike the others, he actually looks like he's not a bumbling idiot.\nThe meat of the series here is that the D-Team must travel around the world capturing dinosaur cards, though usually they seem to be in their full-sized forms that need to be beaten so they will turn into a dinosaur card. And of course, they usually have to deal with the Alpha Gang. Oddly enough, Max's dad gives him and the other D-Team members an electronic device that supposedly acts just like the stones they found, just swipe the card through the slot... wow, isn't technology wonderful? Well, wonderful or absurd, one of the two. At least they included a ginormous manual with it... except that most of the pages are blank because apparently the people who made it don't actually know what it can do.\nOkay, I'm just going to come out and say it... this is a Pokemon clone, pure and simple. It's based on a videogame, which I haven't played, so I don't know if the two games are similar, but the two anime series definitely are. Instead of pokeballs, they have cards. They both have cute little creatures, but in this series they happen to be baby dinosaurs, and when the creatures battle they are made bigger. The kids here are also similar to those in Pokemon. And the bad guys? Yep, Ursula, Zander, and Ed feel very much like \n and \n, and \n.", "Max Taylor is a dinosaur fanatic and the leader of the D-Team, a group of friends devoted to learning all they need to know about dinosaurs. He is the son of Dr. Spike Taylor, a paleontologist assisted by Reese Drake, the older sister of Zoe Drake, one of Max's friends. His second and best friend, Rex Owen, lives with him under the Taylor Family's care while his father is away.\nOne day, Max sees a meteor that crashes into a nearby forest, and wakes up Rex while also calling another friend of his, Zoe. The three investigate, and stumble upon magic stone slabs with images of dinosaurs. Soon enough, the kids are being called out to by the dinosaurs for help. It seems that an organization known as the Alpha Gang, led by Dr. Z, has traveled back in time to hunt down dinosaurs so they could use them to take over the world.\nAnd so, the three kids start traveling around the world, battling the Alpha Gang while hunting down the dinosaurs.\nDinosaur King is based on a Sega game franchise with the same name.

Yep, the prince of the underworld has finally returned to Earth. Man, I was really enjoying life too. But wait... what's this? He isn't here to destroy us all? Sweet! Apparently he's here to seek out and capture (or destroy) rogue demons. Who would have figured the demon prince for a good guy? Well... maybe calling him a good guy is going a bit to far. After all, he is willing take human life in order to kill the demons that inhabit the innocent human hosts. Not like he has a lot of choice in the matter, though.\nAnyway, so Enma arrives on Earth and meets up with Kapaeru, a weird mutant-looking creature who has embraced the 20th century and all it has to offer, such as cell phones and night clubs with pretty girls (he tells everyone that he is wearing a costume so they don't get freaked out by his appearance. Enma brings with him a rather unusual creature that looks like some kind of witch's hat. Called Chapeauji, this guy seems to sleep a lot. Enma often wears him like a hat. Filling out our main cast is Yukihime, an ice maiden demon princess that won't hesitate to encase Enma in a block of ice should he \"accidentally\" spy her in the nude.\nIn order to help track down this demons, the group has set up a detective agency that specializes in supernatural or unexplainable mysteries. Of course, just being passive and waiting for others to seek them out just won't do! Luckily, Kapaeru also has a source that lets him know whenever she hears any kind of strange stories so they can go check it out.\nThe first story focus on a sexy blonde who... how can I say this... men give her money and she gives them pleasure... in private. Her father is German, which is where she gets her stand-out looks... which makes her popular. Of course, she keeps this life hidden from her father. But then she starts getting these visions of horrible deaths, which she is totally freaked out by since the deaths actually seem to be happening. So while the police look for a serial killer, our demon hunters look for the demon.\nThe second story involves a young, naive girl working in a night club where the men all tend to be of the touchy-feely variety. She does not like this, not one bit. Why she doesn't just quit, I still haven't been able to figure out. But no, she doesn't quit, she goes ahead and puts on the short-skirted sailor school uniform and perform her waitressing duties. After a bad night at work, she comes home early to find her \"boyfriend\" (or the guy she thought was her boyfriend, even though all the other girls tried to tell her what he really was) in bed with a hot number.\nSo she freaked, and wished he would die. Then later that night, the doll that he had given her earlier in the day and that she had thrown out the window after her discovery... killed him. When more bodies start showing up, the group investigates, though at first Enma doesn't take it seriously and instead gets distracted by the talent at the night club. Actually, the only one who seems to think this threat to be real is Kapaeru. Of course, Enma will see the eventually see the light as well, just too bad it takes his life being in eminent danger from this demon in order to get him there.\nThis series really seems to be more about atmosphere than anything else. The characters aren't very deep, nor are the mysteries or how they go about solving them. There is some occasional humor, but not nearly enough to classify this as a comedy. Really, it seems like a mojority of the stories focus on not on our main characters, but on the characters involved with whatever weirdness is going on. To me, this just makes the show seem kind of bland." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2006" ], "title" : [ "Kikoushi-Enma" ], "released" : [ "4 OVA episodes" ], "genre" : [ "Horror" ] } }

He doubts the book's power until he tests it out for himself, and to his shock it proves to work with deadly efficiency.\nHe meets a Shinigami (Death God) named \n, who was also bored of his life in the Shinigami Realm. He is the owner of the Death Note and drops it out of boredom. \n decides to undergo a massive plot to completely wipe evil from the world and become its new God, by using the Death Note to kill each and every criminal on Earth. (Even to the point of eliminating anything and anyone that gets in the way of his plans.)\nAs more and more names are written into the Death Note, the world takes attention to the massive number of criminal deaths. The International Police Organization scrambles to find out who is responsible and how the murders are being committed. Gaining the help of the eccentric master detective known as \"\n,\" he makes his presence known to \n (known to the world as \"Kira\"), resulting in a massive battle of wits between the two minds.\nWho will win and who will die first? And what type of \"Justice\" will ultimately prevail in the end?", "Death Note is a 12 volume manga series (plus one extra 13th issue called \"How to Read 13\") that has recently been turned into a 37 episode anime series (plus one 3-hour special) and has a live-action movie that was released in Japan June 17th, 2006.\nIt's about a high school student by the name of Raito. One day he finds a strange book called Death Note. The book reads that if a human's name is written in the Note then that person will die in 40 seconds. At first, Raito didn't believe this, until a few experiments proved him wrong. And also, meeting the Shinigami \n helped him believe in the Note.\nAfter Raito learns a bit more about the Note he begins to 'Cleanse the World', as he puts it. He kills off all the criminals and gains the nickname 'Kira' in the process. Now he has to cleanse the world, and help the Japanese police force try and capture 'Kira' along side Raito's new suspicious enemy who goes simply by the name, \n." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "October 3, 2006" ], "creator" : [ "Takeshi Obata, Tsugumi Ooba" ], "company" : [ "Madhouse", "NTV", "Shueisha", "VAP" ], "title" : [ "Death Note" ], "director" : [ "Tetsuro Araki" ], "released" : [ "37 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/ide.htm", "name" : "Hideki Ide" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/misa.htm", "name" : "Misa Amane" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/ukita.htm", "name" : "Hirokazu Ukita" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/naomi.htm", "name" : "Naomi Misora" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/mogi.htm", "name" : "Kanzo Mogi" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/near.htm", "name" : "Near" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/kiyomi.htm", "name" : "Kiyomi Takada" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/remu.htm", "name" : "Rem" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/l.htm", "name" : "L" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/ryuuku.htm", "name" : "Ryuuuku" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/light.htm", "name" : "Light Yagami" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/aizawa.htm", "name" : "Shuichi Aizawa" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/matsuda.htm", "name" : "Matsuda Touta" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/mikami.htm", "name" : "Teru Mikami" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/matt.htm", "name" : "Matt" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/watari.htm", "name" : "Watari" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/death_note/mello.htm", "name" : "Mello" } ], "genre" : [ "Paranormal", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Mystery" ] } }

I have, however, decided to include it on this site anyway. If you're one of those hard-core anime purists who can't stand seeing a non-anime series on a site dedicated to Japanese Animation, then just press the Back button on your web browser and pretend like you were never here.\nSeeing the action and horror in the first Dead Space DVD, \n, is what got me interested in the videogame, and after only a day of playing the game it immediately jumped up my list to become one of my favorites on the Xbox 360. And now there's both a sequel game and sequel DVD, both which are being released on the same day, January 25, 2011. Oh yeah, you can bet that the DVD was at the top of my Netflix queue. But then something surprising happened... a review copy arrived in the mail! Woo-hoo!\nThe first thing on the DVD was a preview of the new game, which apparently takes place in the mind Isaac, the main character from the first game. The game looks visually stunning, but I usually don't like stories that take place in a dream or in someone's head, so I was rather disappointed to hear that you're just playing through Isaac's dementia. I'm sure I'll get over it once I start playing though, because it does look amazing.\nNext the main feature, Dead Space: Aftermath, started playing, and I was blown away... not by how awesome it was, and not that it was CG instead of the 2D animation of the first film, but because somehow it was actually some particularly bad CG. The kind of detail and animation here felt like it would have been top of the line 10 years ago, or like something you might find on a small child's weekday morning TV show. Is this what Dead Space has been reduced to? Well, thankfully not.\nIt turns out that there actually is some wonderful 2D animation here, showing up to tell flashbacks of four survivors who were rescued from damaged ship USG OBannon that was sent in to investigate the events which took place in the first movie and game. What's cool is that the art style changes for each person's flashback, and that you get to see different versions of the same story. What's not so great is that the story doesn't have a whole lot of depth to it. There is not much sense of purpose for us as the audience watching these characters. What is their goal? Why is it important? Why should we care?\nThe other bad thing is when the flashbacks end, it's jarring because the awful CG returns. I bet it was an issue of time since it had to be released the same day as the game. I'm sure they probably wanted to fix it up and were just unable to because of the time crunch. The movie is slightly shorter than average, clocking in at an hour and 17 minutes, which includes the end credits, and when it's all over, we don't really own the feeling of going through an adventure and coming out with new insights into an overal plot thread. It's more like we watched some people struggle because some higher ups don't care about the little people and then it's over.\nSo I liked the 2D animation and action sequences, and the voice acting was particularly well done, but the story left me wanting much more." ], "jp_info" : { "characters" : [ { "name" : "First Officer" }, { "name" : "Reporter" }, { "name" : "Foster Edgars" }, { "name" : "Rin" }, { "name" : "Holan Stross" }, { "name" : "Sandra" }, { "name" : "Interrogator #2" }, { "name" : "The Overseer" }, { "name" : "Isabel Cho" }, { "name" : "Vivian" }, { "name" : "Lana" } ] } }

We start out following a small survey team on the surface of a dead planet where they soon come across a giant alien artifact. Some believe it may hold the key to God, but it's never explained exactly why anyone believes this... and in fact would seem to be just the opposite, as it seems many of the colonists living in the mining facility begin to go insane and kill themselves or others.\nThe captain of a spaceship called the USG Ishimura is ordered to retrieve the artifact, and thus hauls the thing up from its planetary resting spot. Not a good decision if you ask me considering what it seems to have been doing to the colonists. But the captain has his orders, and so it is brought on board. And from that point on, all hell breaks loose. The colonists are soon all slaughtered by some mysterious force, while onboard the ship people seem to be migrating to the artifact, risking even violence just for a chance to look upon it.\nStrange things are definitely afoot, but we haven't even gotten to the real action yet! Someway, somehow, the nasty alien creatures find their way on board the ship, and now it's up to Alissa Vincent, Chief Security Officer, and her team to track down and exterminate this pest problem before everyone on the ship ends up like the people on the planet. Easier said than done!\nThis movie is all about gore and atmosphere, which it does well. There is very little story here, and even less character development. There are many hints at a larger story, but no follow through. I have not played the game yet, so perhaps it is expanded there. And actually, this movie feels like it could easily be made into a videogame. I wouldn't be surprised to see this prequel made into something playable... eventually. When that happens, I wonder if they'll make a prequel to this prequel?\nCheck out the official website for images, news, and more: \nAn ancient religious artifact has been recovered by a deep-space mining ship, and for the crew of the USG Ishimura, life just became a living hell. Unearthed on a far-away planet during a mining operation, the relic is worshiped by some, even seen as proof of God.

This story shows an older and more mature \n and \n, far more experienced than in the Flash episodes, and now most inseparable from each other. This adventure shows the \"original\" \n and \n in both their faults and finest moments. (You cannot help respect the friendship that these two now have for each other, let alone their now deadly skills.) It also shows how hard they work to earn their \"Dirty Pair reputation. This is the \"real\" nitty gritty Dirty Pair, no pretense here. When these ladies want something, they show they can be very persuasive\nOur story starts with \n laying a trap for several Vizorium smugglers, to which \n is providing the backup. Of course the smugglers can't just give up, no sir! Therefore \n and a slightly late \n end up in a small fire fight. Throw in a medium sized bomb and hey presto, a little collateral damage- whoops.\nMeanwhile, on the planet of Agerna, one of the planet's two major refinery factions is the subject of a vicious attack, and is taking some heavy damage. Since these refinery's process Vizorium, you can guess who is sent to assist.\nAfter \n and \n's arrival, they are shown the damage and then briefed on the local political situation. While \n takes in all the mission details, \n tends to let her attention drift. Next it should be time to do some investigations at the sight of the previous attack. However, \n upsets \n en route with a demonstration of some rather unusual (but extremely skilful) piloting techniques. Needless to say, our ladies reach their destination without incident and look around.\nThe ladies meet with the director of the government plant, who blames the private miners for sabotage. Whilst collecting information on the attacks, the director infers an insult at \n and \n. \n responds in her usual restrained manner and the director is subjected to an example of the \"bad luck\" factor that exists around \n and \n. Worst still, after the dust settles, the girls are filthy.\nUsing their highly developed skills, (honed with thousands of credits of investment from the 3WA), \n and \n find a... bath! Whilst enjoying the most simplest of pleasures, the first of several guests drops in on our ladies (literally). Although some might think this a pleasant thing to do, it's not necessarily so when you are both uninvited and already on \n's black list... poor Carson. Further unwelcome visitors enter, cutting bath time short (what is a girl supposed to do, eh?). Through deftly footwork, a little third party help from Carson, and a quickly executed escape plan, our new threesome exits.\nOur heroines have now left the old refinery and are questioning Carson. Carson won't play ball and demonstrates that he is not scared of 3WA officers, they're just cops after all. \n takes offence at this and elects that they should play bad cop, dangerous cop. Carson soon learns \"you ladies are nuts\" (yep, but lovely nuts). It seems the key to the strange goings on is a Professor Watsman. Carson takes the girls to the professors lab and shows them how to gain access to the fortified labs. However, he uses the opportunity to slip away. (Here confirmation of an unusual situation that seems to be arising becomes apparent, and it's usually \n here!)\nDeep inside the facility, \n, \n and Carson all catch up with the professor, who is a \"few chips short of a motherboard\" (his words not mine). It seems Watsman has a rather strange idea about trying to evolve a dormant life form. Watsman has decided that he will bring his baby into life kicking and screaming. Our threesome, who have been watching, now fall into the chamber, but they are not alone. The three of them have to now fight for survival amongst the mutoids (yuck). Spotting \n and Carson in the chamber, the professor mistakenly believes these two are the evolutionary breakthroughs he has sought and retrieves them, leaving \n on her own!\nWith \n and Carson, Watsman believes he now has the biokey he needs to unlock Sydinga's secret! He is now ready to initiate his final plan. (Plus we find out why Carson is actually here as well). \n, occasionally late but always there, finally turns up with a different look about her... hmmm. Watsman's attention shifts from \n and Carson to \n, who he believes is the product of super evolution. Seemingly trapped, the cavalry arrives in the form of Munghi. Of course no Dirty Pair escape plan ever goes smooth. Where did all those mutoids come from?\nNow faced with hundreds of mutoids, and only a small arsenal between them can our two ladies escape! Time for \n and \n to get down to business and do what they do best. Now armed, these two special 3WA agents show how the Lovely Angels can be more formidable than an entire army.\nMeanwhile, Carson has caught up with Bruno and retrieved the prize that he was so desperately seeking, but he is badly hurt. Carson opts for a few weapons and decides to play rear guard. \n and \n leave Carson to go after Watsman and Bruno, and \n is now a bit pissed. More fired up than usual, \n and \n really do go \"over the top\" and bring down the professor, Bruno, and the entire complex. (Over the Top should definitely be the Lovely Angels anthem). Whilst \n and \n survey the debris, Carson hurt, manages to make it out. With Watsman and Bruno loaded onto the transport, \n takes them all up, for a rendezvous with the \"lovely angel\". Watsman still thinking \n is his own creation, remark's \"what a perfect specimen\" .\nOn the upside, the Lovely Angels successfully wrap up another case with complete success. These ladies aren't just good- they are the BEST! The downside... mishaps will happen, especially where the Dirty Pair have been. Of course they can't be responsible for events that transpire after they leave. But the estimated casualty list is probably around several hundred thousand.\n\"I gave them just one planet, now I give them the whole galaxy\"- Parting comment Professor Watsman 2141 AD\nSo what's so special this \n and \n? This \n and \n are, dare I say it, more realistic. And as much as you may like (or hate) the girls in Dirty Pair Flash, they have now matured into two extremely beautiful (\n especially), dangerous (particularly \n), extremely skilful ladies, and two very special friends. Probably why us lads like them.\nAs for you ladies, \n and \n represent the original hard girls of Manga. They are strong, skilful, tough, kind, and always underrated. They might not quite have the clean cut of \n, but they live in a dirtier world and still rise above it! (And although always remaining competitive between each other, they have thrown away the childish spite they could sometimes show to each other.)" ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1988" ], "creator" : [ "Haruka Takechiho" ], "company" : [ "Studio NUE", "Sunrise" ], "title" : [ "Daatei Pea", "Dirty Pair" ], "director" : [ "Kouichi Mashita" ], "released" : [ "1 movie" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/dirty_pair/gooley.htm", "name" : "Chief Gooley" }, { "name" : "Carson D.

Not since Star Wars has there been so much back story behind one \"legend.\" A long time ago, in this galaxy far, far away, a group of scientists on the planet Arus created a robot named Voltron as the ultimate defense system. But bad guy \n had it out for the robot, and after being defeated several times in his futile attempts, he sent his witch \n to do his dirty work for him. Disguising herself as a goddess in distress, \n put a curse on Voltron that split him into five lion-shaped pieces and forced him into hibernation. Lucky for Voltron, a band of space explorers came along sometime around the 25th century and discovered the five sleeping lions. And none too soon, as \n had already established his reign over the galaxy.\nEach space explorer piloted one of the lion pieces. The leader of the group was \n, who helmed the Black Lion and directed the formation of Voltron. \n, the pilot of the Red Lion, was the sassy one, never missing an opportunity for a sarcastic comment. The Blue Lion pilot was the Norwegian \n, alhtough he was replaced early in the series by the beautiful \n and her caretaker, \n. The tough guy of the pack, \n, piloted the Yellow Lion, while the Green Lion pilot, \n, was remarkably agile despite his outward geekiness.\nWhen the danger got really heavy (and thankfully, it did in every episode), the five lions would form the feet, legs, arms, torso, and head of Voltron. The assembled mega-robot wielded the mighty Sword of Arus in the defense of his people and planet.\nA host of other characters made this galaxy a bustling one. There was Koran, the worry-wart diplomat of the Castle of Lions (Voltron's base of operations), and \n's dead father, \n, who would appear to his daughter in frequent visions. And then there were the evil folk. At \n's side was his right-hand man, the ineffectual Yurak, and \n's son Lotar, who desired only to take his father's place as King of Planet Doom [Planet Galra]. Hagar had her own cronies, including a group of evil monsters known as Robeasts, which were about as effective as a group of Stormtroopers.\nVoltron: Defender of the Universe came to the U.S. in 1984 and took America's youth by storm. A second series featured an all-new Voltron, this one composed of fifteen space exploration vehicles fighting the alien Drules. Titled \n, the new show never gained the popularity of the \"Lion Force,\" fading into relative obscurity over the years. In 1998, the original five-lion Voltron returned for the computer-animated Voltron in the Third Dimension.", "In Japan, TV series are made with a set number of episodes in mind, while the duration of American programming depends upon its popularity. Due to Voltron's high ratings, World Events Productions expanded on the original fifty-two Golion episodes by producing twenty more. They bought the rights to Golion from Toei, wrote twenty scripts and had a Korean company animate them. The episodes (called the \"Second Season\" of Voltron) were aired from 1986 - 1987.\nAmong the changes to the season were two characters: Cossack, a clownish character who fills the role of the bumbling subordinate played earlier in Season One by a short-lived character (Yurak, Lotor's predecessor) and Queen Merla,\na powerful and suave warrior who comes to Planet Doom with an entourage of nobles and soldiers she calls \"dwarflings.\" A classy, cool-headed woman, she attempts to gain the throne of Doom in a short-lived marriage to Lotor, but the prince can never abandon his obsession with Allura. Due to the hurried effect of the season, the writing and animation suffered, and Merla's character was not used to full advantage.\nIn addition to the 20 new episodes, a one hour special was made titled \"Fleet of Doom\", It had a crossover with the \n, in which they were called in to cover for an incomplete Lion Force Voltron. But then both Voltrons teamed up to take on four Robeasts and defeat the forces of planet Doom.", "Centuries ago, there was fierce warrior robot known only as Go-Lion, who boasted that no opponent could defeat him. Soon he wound up facing a winged goddess who was appalled by his arrogance, so to humble him, she had him split into five lion mecha which ended up on the planet Althea.\nIn the year 1999, Earth was in the grip of a devastating war. The only ones who survived the carnage were five youths in a space shuttle: \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n. Their ship was captured by a battlecruiser from the Galra Empire, ruled by the despotic tyrant \n whose main aide was a witch named \n. The five youths managed to escape in a stolen ship to Althea. While making their way to the ruins of an ancient castle, they met the beautiful \n and her military advisor, \n, who sought their help in reviving Go-Lion to defend Althea from monsters from Galra.\nThey succeded in doing so, but not long afterwards, \n was killed by \n, forcing \n to take his place as pilot of the Blue Lion. Later, \n's son, \n, who's every bit as cruel as his father, shows up to battle the Go Lion team.\nEventually, the Go Lion team, joined by \n and \n's younger broher, Sho Shirogane (aka \"Sven II\" in Voltron), take the battle to the planet Galra. In a nutshell, \n became a beastman and was destroyed by Go Lion, \n disappears, and ultimately Sho and \n fight each other to the death.\nThe threat of Galra ended, and our heroes live peaceful lives on Althea afterwards." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1981–1982" ], "title" : [ "Hyakujuu-Ou Go-Lion", "Hundred-Beast King Go Lion" ], "company" : [ "Toei Animation" ], "released" : [ "52 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/mice.htm", "name" : "Castle Mice" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/lance.htm", "name" : "Isamu Kurogane" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/haggar.htm", "name" : "Honerva" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/nanny.htm", "name" : "Hisu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/hunk.htm", "name" : "Tsuyoshi Seido" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/pidge.htm", "name" : "Hiroshi Suzuishi " }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/keith.htm", "name" : "Akira Kogane" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/lotor.htm", "name" : "Crown Prince Sincline" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/alfor.htm", "name" : "Raimon" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/allura.htm", "name" : "Fahra" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/zarkon.htm", "name" : "Emperor Daibazar" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/romelle.htm", "name" : "Princess Omuvei" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/koran.htm", "name" : "Raible" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/voltron/sven.htm", "name" : "Takashi Shirogane " } ], "genre" : [ "Mecha" ] } }

And as you might expect, it has something to do with sex. Okay, so Yumi recently found out that her fiance was not the man that she though he was. How'd it happen, you ask? Alright, I'll tell you! One night he tried to force her to go all the way, even though he had promised her that he would wait until after they were married, like she asked. But Matsunaga simply refused to wait any longer, so a devastated Yumi slapped him across the face and broke off the engagement. Yeah! Of course, that didn't stop him. Bummer. But at least she didn't end up marrying the creep.\n\nWith that whole awful situation behind her, we now find Professor Hayama out at a little party with some of her fellow faculty and students. Although she has had very little to drink, she still feels quite woozy as she tries to leave for the night. And by no coincidence, the vice principal is there to catch her when she just can't stay on her feet any longer. She awakes just a short time later to find her undergarments removed, and the lecherous old vice principal trying to have his way with her... and he's succeeding! Apparently she wasn't supposed to wake up this soon, but luckily for Yumi, it seems the drug he slipped her wasn't powerful enough. This gives her the chance to get the heck out of there before he can go all the way, and she does just that!\n\nSo now the vice principal has a problem, as Professor Hayama's sure to rat him out! So by some means of blackmail, he uses a student, Katsutoshi, to lure our poor Yumi out where another more sinister student, Gondo, can put on a show with her for the camera. And who's the cameraman? Why, Katsutoshi of course! You didn't think it would be the vice principal himself, did you? No way! Mr. vice principal is too busy joining in on the action! Not really a smart move if you ask me. I mean, isn't that tape supposed to be used to blackmail Yumi? Why would you want to put yourself on the blackmail tape like that? Then she'd know for sure that you'll never show it to anyone! Guess his hormones just overruled his common sense.\n\nMan, now that they have that blackmail tape, the vice principal and Gondo have complete control over Yumi! So the next day, they make her go to work with no underwear. That wouldn't be so bad if she could wear pants, but female teachers need to wear skirts! And on top of that, they make wear a vibrator. How do you wear a vibrator, you ask? Well, you'll just have to watch, 'cause I'm not going in to that one! Oh, and it's not just a vibrator, it's a double vibrator! Don't ask, 'cause I'm not going there either! Think that's it? Nope, I've got one more for ya... it's not just a double vibrator, but it's a remote controlled double vibrator, with none other than Gondo at the helm.\n\nAfter classes, the vice principal and Gondo continue with what is now their routine sessions with Professor Hayama. However, this time they decide it would be fun to force Katsutoshi off of the camera and on to Yumi. We don't know exactly what they have on poor Katsutoshi, but whatever it may be, the one thing that is more than apparent is that he has little choice in the matter but to comply with their demands. Could it possibly have something to do with his childhood friend, the petite green-haired second year student Keiko Fujimura? At any rate, he's made to put on a show for our two resident perverts, though they are unable to simply remain spectators.\n\nThe second episode opens with a quite a shocker! The terrible two-some lead Professor Yumi Hayama into a room filled with at least seven guys (and they have funny shaped heads for some reason). These are men who generously donate money to the school, and the vice principal wants to show them his extreme gratitude. But the true shocker is when the final man arrives... who is none other than Matsunaga himself, Yumi's ex-fiance! This does not make her a happy camper... not that she was happy before. Man, what a low blow! And unfortunately, there's no way out of this one. Everyone in the room gets what they want, all but poor Professor Hayama.\n\nAfterwards, Katsutoshi decides that this just can't go on, so he risks everything and sets out to steal all those tapes! Unfortunately, he's caught. Dude should've took some ninja classes first or something. Anyway, it looks like the good guys are gonna lose! Will these evil-doers ever be brought to justice! Watch and see! You wouldn't want me to tell ya everything, now would you? So this title is pretty typical of \n titles. Average art and animation, simple story, similar to many others. The one thing that did stand out is the fact that there are only two women in this entire anime, and Professor Yumi is pretty much the only one to have sex." ], "jp_info" : { "title" : [ "Jo Kyoushi - Yumi No Houkago", "Female Teacher - Yumi's After School" ], "company" : [ "Digital Works" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

Not long after \n fills \n in the he is the great-great-great grandson of the first Vongola Family boss, Giotto, and that the other three candidates before him have been killed. Enrico being the first died in a gunfight. Massimo, the second in line, was found sleeping with the fishes and all that was found of the last, Federico was bones. \n was freaked out and wanting to have nothing to do with the mafia family Vongola as he does for most of the series.\n is the top assassin the top mafia family in all of Italy, the Vongola's. He is the only one in the family with the Deathperation Bullets, that he shoots anyone he sees fit with (though this is normally \n) the effects of the bullet are rather amazing. If the person that is shot with this bullet has regret, they will come back in the underwear only with the will to complete this. After 5 minutes the person will return to normal with no sign of ever being shot but still in there underwear. The bullet also seems to give the person shot with it super human strength and speed. It's also shown that if \n shoots a person some where else with these bullets it will greatly increase the abilities given from that area (as in \n being shot in the knees gave him the ability to jump very very high) which suggest that for the person to have dieing will they must be shot in the head right between the eyes. Also, when a person is under dieing will they not only appear in there underwear but they also have a flame on there forehead, which shows they are under the effects of Deathperation.\nLater on \n shows these using them on \n once to force him to confess to Kyoko knocking Mochida away and making Kyoko run away. Mochida then challenges \n to a fight that \n wins after being shot with deathperation. The first time the other shots were used during a volleyball game where \n is shot in the knees giving him super jumping power and winning the game thus picking up his popularity.\nNot long after Gokudera confronts him claiming he should be the new air to the Vongola family heir he then attacks \n with bombs but once again \n beats him with \n's Deathperation bullets.\n is now much more popular and with two friends, \n and \n, he is much happier but still hates the idea of being a mafia boss.\nThe first big fight is between the Kokuyo Junior High Gang. \n was highly freaked out but was determined to beat them do to the people that they have hurt (Ryohei who was in the hospital and \n who was hurt badly protecting \n) they head off to Kokuyo Land where the gang is hiding out the first person seen is Ken whom \n beats then M.M. who Bianchi takes down with ease. Not even ten minutes later Birds shows up treating Haru and Kyoko's lives by way of mass murder Twins Jiji and Didi. Bird's then tells them to beat up \n and they all refuse save Bianchi who punches \n with out hurting him to much. Then they are told to stab \n or sulfuric acid will be poured on Kyoko's head. When they all refuse \n takes the knife and just before he stabs him self Dr. Shamal saves Kyoko and older I-pin and Lambo save Haru (do to the Ten year bazooka of Lambo's they can switch places with there 10 yr future self for 5 minutes) Lancia was the last to be fought and he tells them he is not Mukuro as they thought. Finally, Mukuro is found and after a long battle and \n's weapons upgrade they are defeated and are dragged of by the Vendicare, something like Mafia police.\nThere is not a long peace before the Varia arrives trying to take the Vongola Rings that Basil brought not long before, luckily though Basil was given fake rings by his master Iemitsu, who is also \n's father. \n punishes Squalo for bringing these fake rings and the real fight begins a tournament of sorts to fight for the rings and the winner will be the next Vongola boss and Vongola ring guardians. While preparing for this \n trains with Basil to fight \n.\nThe first battle is between Ryohei Sasagawa and Lussuria for the Ring of Sun. The battle is in a boxing ring with blinding lights above them. Lussuria has an upper hand in this though because he has glasses and after a little bit of a beating Ryohei defeats Lussuria, grabs Lussuria's half of the ring, and puts it with his showing he is the holder of the Run of Sun.\nThe second battle is between Levi A Than and Lambo for the Vongola Ring of Thunder. Lambo is beaten to the point that he must shoot him self with Ten Year Bazooka twice summoning his 25 year old self and is still beaten. Just before he is killed, \n steps in and causes Levi A Than to be called the winner of this battle and for \n to lose his ring for intruding making it 2 to 1 the Varia having two and Vongola having one.\nThe third battle is between \n and \n for the Storm Ring. With the Cervello bringing in machines which blow hurricane force winds. There fight is the only fight that has a time limit. \n seems almost beaten many times in this fight but never truly goes down for the count only getting more and more crazy as the fight continued. Eventually time is up and bombs attached to the hurricane turbines are set to blow up. Gokudera and \n are fighting on the ground for the ring when \n yells at Gokudera that it is not so important that he should lose his life and he returns living the ring to \n.\nThe 4th battle is between \n and Superbia Squalo and is actually a rather quick battle where water is rising while Squalo and \n fight eventually a shark was released but nether noticed Squalo was beaten and refused \n's help to get away from the gigantic shark when he refuses \n is forced to leave him and he is eaten by the shark. Making \n the rightful holder of the Ring or Rain.\nThe fifth battle is between Mammon (or really Viper) and Chrome Dokuro (who shares a body with Mukuro) Chrome is no match for Mammon until Mukuro takes over appearing as a boy instead of as Chrome and defeating Mammon easily taking the Ring of Mist.\n and Gola Mosca's battle is the last before the final fight. \n takes down Gola Mosca with one strike and goes after \n not noticing Gola Mosca going berserk and attacking everything. By this time, the battle for the Cloud Ring is over due to \n possessing it so when \n steps in to defeat Gola Mosca it is not counted against him. However, the ninth is revealed to be the power supply to the evil machine. \n then begins to talk of how \n struck the ninth down in cold blood but when the ninth wakes, up (seriously injured), he says it is no ones fault but hid for not being able to defeat \n when he kidnapped him. Therefore, this only further strengthens \n's resolve to stop \n claiming the he does not want to be the 10th boss but he diffidently would not allow \n to walk in the 9th's footsteps.\nThe final Battle for the Ring of Sky comes around and all of the guardian's have been poisoned. It is the Sky guardian's job to defeat there opponent and they retrieve the ring from atop a large tower like structure and push it in to the bracelet like device on the guardian's arm to trigger the antidote to the deadly poison they were all given. During there battle \n gives Levi A Than and \n there rings so they can take out the rest of the Vongola Guardians. Meanwhile \n saves Himself and being the only cloud guardian there (Gola Mosca was a robot so it wouldn't have effected him even if he hadn't been smashed to bits) went after \n knocking his ring up to Gokudera so he can heal himself. While \n and \n fight Gokudera runs off saving a already critical Lambo from Levi A Than and then from the poison then goes on to save Chrome bumping into \n who \n gave his ring to after \n ran from the fight saying he would love to continu\n e but had to do something else which was surely an excuse for being afraid of \n. Not long after Ryohei and Chrome are saved. Chrome from \n, Mammon, and Ryohei from the poison.\nAfter a long and tiring battle, \n was able to copy the event from the Cradle Affair (which was learned about during this fight) and use d the Zero Point Break Through freeze \n. Thus, the Battle was one and the Vongola Family became the rightful airs to the Vongola Rings.\nA couple of days after a party that was held for there winning (under the disguise of being for Lambo getting out of the hospital since the Mafia is being hidden from Haru Kyoko and Nana) \n is hit with the ten year bazooka but no older \n shows up in five minutes younger \n doesn't return \n and the rest look for him and eventually \n decides to go to the future to look there. When he arrives, he is in a coffin showing the future \n is dead. Not long after \n shows up as a 25 year old and explains a small amount of what is going on but before much is said, his past self shows up. They then are attacked by Lal Mirch who find out who they are and takes them away where they find more enemies along with meeting older \n, Haru, Kyoko, Lambo, and I-pin who not long after return to there younger selves. It then becomes evident they will not be returning soon and they defeat there enemies with help of devices called Boxes which react to there fl\n ame and create a weapon for them. They defeat there enemies and return to the base where they find \n is also dead in the future as are all of the acroblanco except for Lal Mirch.\nAfter many descending events as in \n training \n and him going thought the Vongola Trial something all bosses must face but none have faced so young. \n finds the bloody and horrible truth of the Vongola family and says he would rather destroy the Vongola's than except it even thought he agrees in the end. Also Chrome in her younger forum is brought after fighting Glo Xinia and do to Mukuro's \"death\" (it's unknown yet if he really is even though Glo says he killed him you never really know with Mukuro) her organs are failing but \n stops her and forces her to create her own by giving her more power. Lastly, Gokudera's Past is reviled by \n and his sister but he still struggles with his training. Along with a message, arriving from Older \n and Squalo saying for them to stay put and further instruction will come latter." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "October 7, 2006" ], "creator" : [ "Akira Amano" ], "company" : [ "Artland" ], "title" : [ "Katekyo Hitman Reborn!", "Home Tutor Hitman Reborn" ], "director" : [ "Kenichi Imaizumi" ], "released" : [ "152 TV Episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/belphegor.htm", "name" : "Belphegor" }, { "name" : "I-pin" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/hayato.htm", "name" : "Hayato Gokudera" }, { "name" : "Iemitsu Sawada" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/kyoya.htm", "name" : "Kyoya Hibari" }, { "name" : "Irie Shoichi" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/reborn.htm", "name" : "Reborn" }, { "name" : "Ken Joshima" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/takeshi.htm", "name" : "Takeshi Yamamoto" }, { "name" : "Kyoko Sasagawa" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/tsuna.htm", "name" : "Tsunayoshi Sawada" }, { "name" : "Lal Mirch" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/katekyo_hitman_reborn/xanxus.htm", "name" : "Xanxus" }, { "name" : "Lambo" }, { "name" : "Bianchi" }, { "name" : "Lancia" }, { "name" : "Birds" }, { "name" : "Levi A Than" }, { "name" : "Byakuran" }, { "name" : "Lussuria" }, { "name" : "Chikusa Kakimoto" }, { "name" : "M.M." }, { "name" : "Colonnello" }, { "name" : "Mukuro Rokudo/Chrome Dokuro" }, { "name" : "Dino Chiavorone" }, { "name" : "Nana Sawada" }, { "name" : "Dr. Shamal" }, { "name" : "Ryohei Sasagawa" }, { "name" : "Futa" }, { "name" : "Skull" }, { "name" : "Gamma" }, { "name" : "Spanner" }, { "name" : "Genkishi" }, { "name" : "Superbia Squalo" }, { "name" : "Glo Xinia" }, { "name" : "Twins" }, { "name" : "Gola Mosca" }, { "name" : "Uni" }, { "name" : "Hana Kurokawa" }, { "name" : "Verde" }, { "name" : "Haru Miura" }, { "name" : "Viper" } ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy" ] } }

training, he crash lands on the world of Popstar and meets the residents of Cappy Town. As it turns out, the world of Popstar is threatened by \n, a powerful demon that has a gigantic army of monsters, most of which are distributed by Nightmare Enterprises. \n has destroyed many worlds, although they have been opposed by the Star Warriors.\nIt is rumored that a legendary hero will soon come to destroy \n for good. And to the Cappy's surprise, it turns out to be \n. \n stays on Popstar and befriends the residents of Cappy Town. However, he is antagonized by \n and his assistant \n.\n tries to get rid of \n by ordering monsters from Nightmare Enterprises. However, none of them are any match for \n's inhaling powers, which can give him the ability/power of any enemy he sucks up. Will \n live up to his destiny and defeat \n?\nNote: In the English dubbed version, many episodes are aired out of order. The Japanese version is mostly episodic, except for a few story arcs. However, the Dub skips over a number of them, even to the point of using scenes from episodes later in the series in older ones, thus officially throwing the original continuity out of order." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct 6, 2001–Sept 27, 2003" ], "creator" : [ "Masahiro Sakurai, Nintendo" ], "company" : [ "WARPSTAR", "A-UN Entertainment", "TBS", "HAL Laboratory", "Nintendo" ], "title" : [ "Hoshi no Kabii", "Kirby of the Stars" ], "director" : [ "Soji Yoshikawa" ], "released" : [ "100 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/3_color_fighters.htm", "name" : "3 Color Fighters" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/kung_fu_lee.htm", "name" : "Kung Fu Lee" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/acore.htm", "name" : "Acore" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/lady_like.htm", "name" : "Memu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/alien.htm", "name" : "Alien" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/large_pole_old_man.htm", "name" : "Large Pole Old Man" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/amon.htm", "name" : "Amon" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/lead_crow.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/anige.htm", "name" : "Anige" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/lord_james.htm", "name" : "Sir Jim Korito" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/backdrop_kirby.htm", "name" : "Backdrop Kirby" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/lovely.htm", "name" : "Lovely" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/baton_kirby.htm", "name" : "Baton Kirby" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mabel.htm", "name" : "Mabel" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/belly_buster.htm", "name" : "Belly Buster" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/maimaigoon.htm", "name" : "Maimaigon" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/benikage.htm", "name" : "Benikage" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/masher.htm", "name" : "Masher" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/biggie.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/masher_2.htm", "name" : "Powered Masher" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/blade_knight.htm", "name" : "Blade Knight" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/master_green.htm", "name" : "Master Green" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/blocky.htm", "name" : "Blocky" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/max_flexer.htm", "name" : "Matchosan" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/bomb_kirby.htm", "name" : "Bomb Kirby" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mayor_len_blustergas.htm", "name" : "Mayor Ren Blustergas" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/bonkers.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/melman.htm", "name" : "Moso" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/bony.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/meta_knight.htm", "name" : "Sir Meta Knight" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/book.htm", "name" : "Book" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mike_kirby.htm", "name" : "Mike Kirby" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/bouncy_tiff.htm", "name" : "Bouncy Fumu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mini_galbo.htm", "name" : "Mini Galbo" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/boxer_tyson.htm", "name" : "Boxer Tyson" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mini-monsters.htm", "name" : "Mini-Monsters" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/broom_king.htm", "name" : "Broom King" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mirror_kirby.htm", "name" : "Mirror Kirby" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/bugzzy.htm", "name" : "Bugzzy" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mole.htm", "name" : "Mole" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/buttercup.htm", "name" : "Buttercup" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mosugaba.htm", "name" : "Mosugaba" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/captain_kick.htm", "name" : "Captain Kick" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mr_chip.htm", "name" : "Mr. Chip" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/captain_stitch.htm", "name" : "Captain Stitch" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/kirby/mr_p_umpkin.htm", "name" : "Mr. P.

First off, the visual style is completely different from standard anime. There is no cell-style here, it just looks pretty much like a comic strip come to animated life... which is convenient considering \n started out as a newspaper comic strip. Although the animation was all done with computers, it really appears as if it were made completely from hand drawn pencil sketches with watercolors. Only the occasional sweeping camera angels give hint that this work of art actually exists in a 3D computer environment. I though the bobsled ride down the wedding cake was especially well done.\n\nThe next difference between this film and regular anime movies is the way it flows. Again, it is laid out like a comic strip come to animated life, which fits perfectly with the visual style. There is no overall story or plot here, just a lot of little mini-stories about the Yamada family, and the style works very well. It is also convenient if you just want to watch a little bit at a time. Since this movie was based on a comic strip, the overall tone is that of comedy, and some of the scenes are truly hilarious, like the remote control battle between the two parents that plays out like a martial arts competition. I'm sure every review you read will have some mention of that scene, which is probably the funniest thing in the whole film.\n\nThis film may be a comedy, but that doesn't mean that every scene is written to be funny. Like any film, there is variety here. Some portions are romantic, some are relaxing, and some are even nerve-wracking, like when the family accidentally leaves their third-grade daughter at the mall, or when the father goes out to confront a group of loud, obnoxious punks. Mostly, though, the scenes and skits are about just the little things in life, such as what's for dinner or a forgotten umbrella. What's cool is that all of the scenes entertaining, no matter what emotions they may be invoking at the time.\n\nThe Yamada family consists of six members. Takashi, the husband and father, is a middle-aged man with a run-of-the-mill job providing a perfectly normal middle-class life. Matsuko, the wife and mother, is a full-time housewife. As such, she stays at home and takes care of the household chores while looking after the kids. Noboru, their son, is currently in junior high, and is just your average, non-excelling student who is always being pestered to study harder. Nonoko, their daughter, is the youngest member of the family. She is currently in third grade, and often speaks very loudly. Shige, Matsuko's mother, also lives with the family. She helps out with the chores and shopping, and constantly reminds them that she owns the land on which their house is built. Pochi, their lazy dog, rounds out the family.\n\nSeeing how the US version was produced by Disney, the dubbing is excellent. All the voices fit their characters perfectly, and all the acting seems to be dead on with the Japanese version, showing that they really took their time and did it right. The end result is a great movie that would make a nice addition to anyone's anime collection. Not only will it keep both adults and kids entertained the entire way through, but it can be enjoyed in little snippets for when time is short or you just don't feel like sitting though a whole movie. Also included on the DVD is a behind the scenes with the voice actors, and some original storyboards for comparison with the final film." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "July 17, 1999" ], "creator" : [ "Hisaichi Ishii" ], "company" : [ "Studio Ghibli" ], "title" : [ "Houhokekyo Tonari no Yamada-kun" ], "director" : [ "Isao Takahata" ], "released" : [ "1 movie" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Kikuchi" }, { "name" : "Nonoko Yamada" }, { "name" : "Matsuko Yamada" }, { "name" : "Shige Yamada" }, { "name" : "Ms. Fujiwara" }, { "name" : "Takashi Yamada" }, { "name" : "Noboru Yamada" } ], "genre" : [ "Comedy" ] } }

How in the world can she explain THIS little problem to her rock star boyfriend?", "\nIf you're watching the US version, then \n is an extremely busty college student who moonlights as an actress/model. If you're watching the original Japanese version, then there's no doubt that \n is instead an extremely busty high-school student... because, as if you didn't know, in the US every high-school student is underage and none of them ever have sex. At any rate, in both versions she's extremely busty, and has an extremely bad attitude. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, without regard for rules, regulations, or even people's feelings. Of course, you might do that too if your beauty and assets would let you get anything you wanted.\n\nProfessor Sushiaki Karasawa sees this gorgeous young lady in a commercial on a store television while out walking one evening, and in a remarkable coincidence, he then immediately spies the same woman directly in front of him, walking down the same sidewalk and wearing the school uniform of the \"college\" that he works at... except that she had brown eyes, and the woman in the commercial had blue eyes. In an attempt to find out if these two women are actually the same person, he comes up with a plan to make her admit it... he waits until she is alone, grabbing a drink from a vending machine, then comes up behind her and says that he found one of her brown contact lenses.\n\nThe plan works... well, sort of. It accomplishes his goal of finding out that the student is in fact the actress he saw in the commercial, but unlike the scene that played out in his overactive imagination, she is extremely rude to him and quickly dismisses him. Not what he was expecting at all, yet, despite her behavior toward him, his crush remains. \n eventually uses this crush of his so that she may stay at his apartment one night. Of course, Sushiaki takes this to mean that she wants to sleep with him... boy, is in for a disappointing surprise! But on the bright side, he does get to see her naked thanks to a well-played game of rock-paper-scissors.\n\nMost of the comedy from that first episode comes in the form of Professor Sushiaki's active imagination. This completely changes in the next episode, where Professor Sushiaki rarely even shows up, if he does at all. In this episode, we learn that \n has a rock star boyfriend named Hiroyuki, though their relationship seems to be on the rocks after \n catches him with another woman. But then something strange happens... when a girl living in the same apartment complex as Hiroyuki stepped onto the same elevator that Hiroyuki and \n were on, \n immediately does a 180, going over to kiss Hiroyuki and asking if she can stay the night.\n\nThe next morning, \n discovers that the young woman from the elevator, Azumi Yamada, not only lives in the apartment right next to Hiroyuki, but that she goes to the same school as \n. Now, \n continues to act like her normal, rude self, but inside she begins to feel something... strange. She doesn't know what this feeling is at first, just that she is unable to get Azumi out of her head. When she finally realizes that she has a crush on Azumi, she is devastated. But how does that compare to what she feels when she eventually comes to terms with her feelings... only to find that Azumi is now completely ignoring her because of her previous poor behavior?\n\nNow \n tries to do everything she can to become Azumi's friend, and seeing how kind and friendly of a girl Azumi is, this doesn't take too long. Of course, Azumi doesn't view \n the same way \n views her... so \n's new obsessive behavior starts to creep Azumi out. And adding to this whole situation is Hiroyuki, who feels completely rejected when he discovers \n's secret feelings for Azumi. So he decides to take matters into his own hands and prepares to seduce the young Azumi. Will he succeed in taking Azumi's innocence?

He spends a whole week out of school practicing his soccer and improving his skills. His teammates also help him along the way with their support. Most of the students at Josui now look up to Sho as a role model because he's always trying his best, never gives up and he believes there's always room for improvement.\nWith a new team Josui is ready for the spring tournament, but unfortunately their first match is up against Musashinomori. After a long and hard game Josui looses 2-3, however there is a bright side. Lots of the students at Josui were inspired by the game against Musashinomori that they wanted to join. One of the students that they got was a must have. His name is Daichi Fuwa, the soon to be GK (Goal Keeper). With the District Primary tournament coming up Josui's got a lot of pressure on them and it's not just soccer problems. The exams are coming up and if even one student from the soccer team gets a below average score they loose the soccer team.

So today she's starting her first day as a nurse at Aoshima General Hospital. And just so there's no doubt what goes on there behind closes doors, we're treated a scene of the insatiable nurse Ryoko gladly takes care horny Congressman Ishigami.\n\nMaya's first day on the job starts out well and seems to be go pretty smooth, well, at least until she runs straight into Dr. Nimura, her ex-boyfriend! What are the odds?! And if that didn't suck enough, later that night nurse Ryoko and Congressman Ishigami set her up so Ishigami can try out the new girl. What a diabolical pair! Ryoko drugs Maya's coffee, then Ishigami presses the call button for a nurse to help with a problem... a problem that is immediately visible due to the outline in his hospital gown. Once the drug takes effect, Ishigami lays her down on his bed, all the while Ryoko remains out at the desk, pleasuring herself while she imagines what's going on in the room. And of course, in true hentai fashion, Maya resists at first but soon begins to enjoy it, eventually wanting more.\n\nDr. Nimura happens across Ryoko as she is enjoying her fantasy, and the sight makes him immediately hard. This then causes him to panic and take off running down the dark hallway... where he eventually comes across a room from which some unexpected sounds are coming. Luckily, the door to the room is cracked open just enough for him to be able to peek inside, and what else does he see but Dr. Hitori and nurse Satsuki Aoyagi making out... which quickly leads to other forms of enjoyment, if you know what I mean, oh yes, and I think you do. Of course, Dr. Nimura, being the gentleman that he is, continues to watch everything. He better be careful, though, as you never know who might be walking the halls at night!\n\nThe next night a bunch of the gang from work decides to go out for a little fun, and for once this is NOT the kind of fun you're probably thinking about. This time it's a restaurant! Dr. Nimura happens to get a little tipsy from all the sake, and publicly confesses his love for Maya, who also happens to be there, sitting at the bar. Of course, she's still ticked off at him and doesn't take it seriously. Too bad, 'cause Nimura has way too much to drink by the end of the night, and winds up outside kissing a light post. If Maya had been there for him, I'm sure all their relationship woes would have been over, but instead Ryoko was there, and all too willing to help him out.\n\nHe awakes the next morning, shocked to see a naked Ryoko right there next to him. Having no memory of what happened the previous night after he left the bar, he hurries to work, worried that Maya might know about what he and Ryoko did. This is a lovely scene, as it shows he still does really care for Maya. Of course, that doesn't stop him from being seduced by a bubbly female patient named Maika. Just think of it as practice... yeah, that's it! It sort of makes sense, as Maya and Nimura's past relationship problems all seemed to be cause by the one simple fact of Nimura being too nervous to be able to get \"it\" up. So if he can do it now, with this lovely young patient, then perhaps he will be cured!\n\nSo after last night's fling with nurse Ryoko when he was drunk and relaxed, and the little romp with seductive Maika just now, Nimura's confidence level is at an all time high. All he has to do is get up the courage to tell Maya how he really feels! Oh, wait, first he needs to convince her to listen to what he has to say, and that's not going to be as easy as you'd think, considering he just recently told her that he wasn't serious when he professed his love for her that night at the bar. Why would he do such a thing? Oh, it was just a big old misunderstanding on his part. He should she was referring to something else. Then, even if he can get the courage to talk to her AND convince her to listen, will Maya even want to take him back after he so coldly dumped her?" ], "jp_info" : { "genre" : [ "Hentai" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "title" : [ "Heisa Byouin" ] } }

Okay, so obviously from the title we know this takes place in a hospital. This hospital is called Date General Hospital, and is ran by the handsome, charismatic doctor Ryuichi Date. As you might expect, Director Date selects and trains nurses to be \"special nurses\" that cater to the patients' every sexual need. And that's about the whole plot. There's also something involving a home-made pharmaceutical drug that enhances sexual pleasure when applied to the skin, but that's never really delved into other than them saying it exists and using it.\n\nWhen we start the story, we see one of Dr. Date's special nurses, a lovely, busty green-haired woman named Saeko Morishita, demonstrating her training on Mou Fujimiya, some rich guy who gives funding to Dr. Date... but then he's not seen again. And everything after that is pretty much just sex. You know how most video games have a few cut-scenes between the action? Well, that's pretty much what this has, a few scenes in between the sex scenes that are there not to move any kind of story along, but to segue into another sex scene. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing... after all, it means you won't be needing to fast forward very often, if you know what I mean...\n\nOkay, so since there's nothing else to summarize, then... uh... well, lets see what sex scenes there are. I already mentioned the one with Saeko and Mr. Fujimiya. Doctor Date and Rei Sakaki, his sexy blonde assistant (or partner, I'm not sure which), stand by watching that happen, and Rei even joins a little... but just a little. Then Date and Rei go at it in his office. Then we get a short scene where Dr. Date performs an emergency operation on someone who was just in a car accident. One of the new nurses, Sayaka, seems to recognize the guy, and Date sees an opportunity... yeah, like he needs one. Even though Matsuhiko is stable, Date convinces Sayaka that the only possible way to save the leg of Matsuhiko, who is Sayaka's boyfriend, is for he, himself to operate, instead of the doctors who are supposed to take care of him. Of course, he'll only do this if she agrees to become a special nurse.\n\nOkay, so there's that scene with Dr. Date and Sayaka, then there's a scene with Dr. Date and Saeko, and then a scene with Dr. Date, Saeko, and Sayaka. And that ends the first episode. The second episode starts off introducing us to a new nurse, Minako Kisaragi, a very, very busty blue-haired widow. For some reason, they misspelled her name on the credits as Miyako. Anyway, she's so busty that her breasts actually force her shirt to pop open when she's being introduced to Sayaka and Saeko... and their both impressed. Then were treated to another sex scene with Dr. Date and Rei, but this time it's outside, first up against a chain link fence and then on the ground. During this, Dr. Date starts fantasizing about Minako, first about what she does when she's alone, and then what it would be like if he was doing her right now. It' actually kind of cool to see Rei morphing into Minako, and then morphing back into Rei.\n\nNext, the nurses visit what looks to be the children's ward, cause the boys all appear to be like around 15 or 16 years old... or course, this is America, so their obviously 18 years old and just haven't hit puberty full force yet. That's not to say that haven't hit it at all, though, since when the nurses walk by and bend over wearing their tight short-skirted uniforms, we do find them the boys blushing and... uh... pitching tents. One of them even gets some action, but that's after another scene with Dr. Date and Sayaka... oh yeah, and a scene with Minako by her lonesome, being watched by Dr. Date before he decides to join in. So who does the boy get? Minako... in a threesome with Dr. Date... which is before Sayaka decides to join in and take over for Dr. Date... and then all four of just go at it... hm, I think I've said enough." ], "jp_info" : { "genre" : [ "Hentai" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Hiroshi Murakami" }, { "name" : "Ryuichi Date" }, { "name" : "Minako Kisaragi" }, { "name" : "Saeko Morishita" }, { "name" : "Mou Fujimiya" }, { "name" : "Sayaka Ogata" }, { "name" : "Rei Sakaki" } ], "title" : [ "Shiroki Tenshitachi No Rondo", "Ring of White Angels" ] } }

During their journey Hamel and Flute are joined by Raiel, a magical pianist, and together fight against the kings of the demonic army, who are attempting to resurrect their imprisoned demon lord Kestra.\nThe movie is based more heavily on the manga series, and does not exactly fit with the series. In the movie Hamel is a dominating selfish jerk, joined by Flute, Raiel and Hamel's sister Sizer. While on their journey to the Northern Capital Hamel's party find a town which has been ravaged by demons. The demons have taken the princess of the town captive, and the townspeople beg the great hero Hamel to save her. He (grudgingly) accepts and the group find themselves wandering in the old castle of Medusa.

Raised in an orphanage since he was little, Chitose Hitotose only recently moved out and into the house that his parents left him. But when his teachers witness his delinquent attitude and poor grades, they each decide to unofficially adopt him and all wind up moving in at exactly the same time.\nEach of these teachers have their own distinct methods for how to go about improving Chitose, and these methods often conflict and snowball leaving Chitose in all sorts of outlandish situations. Mutsuki Ichimonji is Chitose's homeroom teacher and seems to be the most balanced of the group, if such a thing is possible. She strongly encourages Chitose to study STUDY STUDY! Kisaragi Ninomai is the science teacher who is almost like a mad scientist. She is very technology advanced, creating all sorts of inventions... which often fail, and usually cause Chitose a fair amount of pain. This is the only class he does extremely well in, because as he sees it, failing to pay attention in this class could mean instant death.\nYayoi Sanzenin is the beautiful school nurse who always has a horde of boys outside her office door pleading all sorts of ridiculous excuses for needing to see her. She is also a Shinto priestess and very handy with a sword which she sometimes uses to influence Chitose's attitude. Uzuki Shitenno is the art teacher, who's child-like attitude and petite body could easily cause her to be mistaken for a student. And finally there's Satsuki Gokajo, the gym teacher, who is all about strength, stamina, and exercise. She is the loudest and rashest of the group, often pummeling Chitose without even realizing it.\nThis show really seems to strike a good balance between the comedic gags, the story, and the characters. Unlike some other anime series I watched recently, this one is really easy to get into and start caring about the characters and wanting to see what's going to happen to them next. Even though pretty much nobody has been in the situation that Chitose is in, it's still very easy to feel for this character and what he's going through.\nNote: Each of the teachers last names because with a Japanese number, Ichi (one), Ni (two), San (three), Shi (four), and Go (five).\nThe box set DVD release of \n from \n contains three discs, each in its own slimline clamshell DVD case, all packaged neatly into a what feels like a high-quality cardboard case with beautiful artwork on each side. A total of 17 episodes are included, the 14 episodes of Season 1 plus 3 OVA episodes. The OVA episodes were actually created before the TV series, and there were five of them, so hopefully when \n releases the next season, \n, the release will include the final two OVA episodes." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2001" ], "title" : [ "Happy Lesson" ], "released" : [ "13 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Chitose Hitotose" }, { "name" : "Yayoi Sensei" }, { "name" : "Fumitsuki Nanakorobi" }, { "name" : "Mutsuki Ichimonji" }, { "name" : "Haduki Yazakura" }, { "name" : "Satsuki Gokajou" }, { "name" : "Kisaragi Ninomai" }, { "name" : "Uduki Shitennou" }, { "name" : "Minaduki Rokumatsuri" } ], "genre" : [ "Comedy", "Drama", "Romance" ] } }

While he has friends and family just like everyone else, there is one major difference... Samatarou is a god in training. His father, Osamu Kamiyama, is a god as well, and opted to have his only son live a life like a human so that when the time came to become a god, Samatarou would become a better god because he spent time studying humans.\nAlong with his father, Samatarou lives with his mother, Venus Kamiyama, who is a goddess, his two sisters, Misa Kamiyama and Meme Kamiyama who are goddess candidates, as well as with his guardian angel, Tenko. Tenko was born at the same time and on the same date as Samatarou was, and was found outside the hospital that Samatarou was born in.\nWhile Samatarou and Tenko are attending high school, Samatarou falls in love with a transfer student named Kumiko Komori. She was only there for a few days before she left, due to family concerns. Samatarou was heart broken, but eventually snapped out of it. However, it didn't last long, because Kumiko came back, and asked Samatarou to be her boyfriend. We later find out that Kumiko is a devil/demon, and was only dating Samatarou in order to gain his soul for her mother, Fumiko; but during the time that they were dating, Kumiko began to actually fall in love with Samatarou.\nRight after Samatarou breaks up with Kumiko, we find out that her mother was manipulating Kumiko so that she could gain Samatarou's power. A large battle ensues, and Venus, Misa, and Meme are attacked by Fumiko while at home. Samatarou heard his mother's voice as he ran after Fumiko, telling him to use persuasion instead of violence. He meets up with Fumiko and Kumiko in the park, and it looks as though Kumiko is going to attack and kill Samatarou. However, she changes her mind and attempts to kill her mother. Samatarou finally realizes that in order to kill the devil that lurks within all of us, he has to kill it within himself.\nBy doing this, Samatarou kills Fumiko, injuring himself gravely in the process, and the only thing that Tenko and Kumiko could do is pray. While doing this, Kumiko becomes redeemed and gains her wings as an angel. Both women prayed with all they could, and that in turn saved Samatarou's life.\nIn the end, Kumiko came to live with the Kamiyama family, and everything went back to normal. As normal as life can be for a house full of gods, goddesses, and angels.", "Samatarou Kamiyama is the son of a God, though he lives in the human world in order to learn more about humans so that he may become a better God. He is accompanied by his guardian angel, Tenko, who also happens to be his best friend. She lives with the Kamiyamas in the Kamiyama family household, too.\nSamatarou falls for a transfer student named Kumiko Komori one day, unaware of Tenko's love for him." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "May 20 2006–August 10 2006" ], "creator" : [ "Yoshikazu Kuwashima" ], "company" : [ "Toei Animation" ], "title" : [ "Kamisama Kazoku" ], "director" : [ "Kimitoshi Chioka" ], "released" : [ "13 episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Ai Tachibana" }, { "name" : "Osamu Kamiyama" }, { "name" : "Fumiko Komori" }, { "name" : "Samatarou Kamiyama" }, { "name" : "Kumiko Komori" }, { "name" : "Shinichi Kirishima" }, { "name" : "Lulu" }, { "name" : "Suguru" }, { "name" : "Meme Kamiyama" }, { "name" : "Tenko" }, { "name" : "Misa Kamiyama" }, { "name" : "Venus Kamiyama" } ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Comedy", "Fantasy", "Romance" ] } }

A train appears out of the night sky...a train from the Galactic Railroad. With his friend Campanella, Giovanni boards this train bound for the edge of the universe.\nNight on the Galactic Railroad is a very symbolic story which adheres to the symbolism of the novel. There is symbolism in the people on the train, in its path, and in many other things: traits which Matsumoto later kept in mind when he created the three-nine. It also carries religious overtones.

The animation was through TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan- now extinct) and the English version was produced by Fred Ladd and Al Singer through Delphi Associates inc. Peter Fernandez wrote the English lip sync scripts for at least half of the episodes and was paid $100 to $125 per episode. The series had a catchy theme song from Lou Singer and Gene Raskin. The following production information is from Kelly Lannan.\nJAPANESE BROADCAST INFO\nThe following information is from Fredd Ladd:\n\nSo what this means is that: The first series #1-25 were all untranslated; our Gigantor episodes started at the 2nd Series #27 (episode 2 of the second block until its end). The 3rd block of 13 episodes were probably repeats or Japanese only episodes.\nThe series was shown on Melbourne TV in January 1968 through Translux, on channel 0 at 5:00pm. It was described by the tv week as \"Animated science fiction series about the world's mightiest robot, and 12 year old \n who controls the jet propelled giant.\" After the success of \n on the international market, Gigantor became the most popular Japanese export during this time. The idea was simple- a boy named \n fights crime around the world with the help of a huge remote controlled robot. Whoever has the remote control, controls \n. The series is set in the year 2000. Gigantor was made of steel, complete with a rocket powered backpack for flight, a pointy nose, eyes that never moved, and incredible strength, but no intelligence. \n is the nephew of \n and lives with him on a remote island. \n usually wears shorts and a jacket, and even carries a gun.\n\n\n's voice was that of Billy Lou Watt (who was female, not male as many people are led to believe). She was also the voice of \n and Kimba. The voice of \n was Cliff Owen, who also played \n from \n and Dan'l Baboon from \n. Peter Fernandez was the voice of Dick Strong, who also played \n from \n and Pauley Cracker from \n. Peter Fernandez was the voice for many characters as well. The names were all whimsical with characters such as Dick Strong who was a secret agent, and a funny policeman named \n who joined with \n, \n and \n on their adventures against enemies such as the Spider, Ungablob, General Von Que Ball, Dubble Trubble, Dr. Katzmeow, and Prince Abdul Ben Hothead, and there were plenty of other robots that \n had to defeat.\nIn the last episode titled \"The Secret Valley\", The Gigantor team decide to holiday in Australia to see the kangaroos. They end up in the bush on a sheep station. They call the natives \"savages\" and, instead of being Aborigines, are Indians with feathers on their heads riding horses. It goes to show what little the Japanese knew of Australia at that time. The dubbing team tried to imitate our accents, but didn't come close.

If you're one of those hard-core anime purists who can't stand seeing a non-anime series on a site dedicated to Japanese Animation, then just press the Back button on your web browser and pretend like you were never here.\nOver a thousand years ago, a clan of gargoyles had guarded a castle and its inhabitants on the Scottish coast. However, because of a great misunderstanding during an attack from Vikings, that group was placed in a deep sleep... until the castle they guarded and was their home rose above the clouds... in the 20th Century!\nHowever, the ambitious industrialist David Xanatos found out about the legend, bought the castle, and reconstructed it as his skyscraper home. Now these gargoyles are freed from their stony slumber... only to find they were now in 20th Century New York City. They now have to adjust to this new age, as well as finding new enemies... and new allies along the way.\nNOTE: Many of the voice actors in some of the episodes of the series were also actors in the various \"Star Trek\" series of the late 1980's to mid 1990's.", "Gargoyles is an epic story that begins in Scotland in the year 994 A.D. Gargoyles are creatures that are immobilized in stone by day, but when night arrives, they awaken from their stone slumber in order to help defend their home. However, they are betrayed leaving only six surviving Gargoyles. A curse was placed on each of them, forever imprisoning them in stone \"Until the castle rises above the clouds.\"\nFlash forward 1000 years later. An wealthy and eccentric businessman named David Xanatos buys the castle where the Gargoyles sleep, placing them on top of a Skyscraper \"above the clouds\" in New York City. The curse is finally lifted and the six are reunited once again. However, they are shocked to find themselves 1000 years into the future, and have a hard time adjusting to the more modern 20th Century lifestyle.\nTheir mistrust of humans deepens even further after they are tricked by Xanatos, though later they are betrayed by one of their own as well. But they also befriend a Policewoman named Elisa Masa. With her help they adjust to this new time and find a new home where they can be safe from their enemies. Now under the oath to protect their home of New York City, they become \"protectors of the night\" battling any evil that crosses their path. However, they discover that they are not alone. The Past and Future will intertwine and they'll soon learn that the World of the Gargoyles is much bigger than they have ever imagined." ], "jp_info" : { "characters" : [ { "name" : "Demona" }, { "name" : "Princess Katherine" }, { "name" : "Duncan" }, { "name" : "Talon/Derek Masa" }, { "name" : "Elesa Masa" }, { "name" : "Thalirog" }, { "name" : "Fox" }, { "name" : "The Magus" }, { "name" : "Goliath" }, { "name" : "The Wyird Sisters" }, { "name" : "Halcyon Renard" }, { "name" : "Titania/Anastasia Renard" } ] } }

Even though it was at first described as an \n rip-off, eventually Gasaraki outgrew that tag. Unlike other robot shows, it takes place in the not so far future, its concept is very realistic, and the robots look very realistic.\nThe Gowa family has been the world's best arms company for over a thousand years. Their newest creation is the TA (Tactical Armor): the Earth's first bi-pedal weapon which has been inducted into the JSSDF (Japanese Self Defense Force). One of the test pilots is Yushiro Gowa, the youngest son of the Gowa family. He is also the test subject for the ancient dance of Gasaraki, which is performed at the ancient stage of stone. Little does he know that the Gasaraki dance is the key to summoning the Kugai, an ancient creature that the TA is based on, that will bring on \"The Terror\" that will kill almost all the people. When he's close to doing it, a mysterious girl (Miharu) comes and stops the process.\nLater, a country called Belgistan is at war. Yushiro and his TA team are sent there to stop it and Yushiro encounters Miharu again. He realizes that she's the top pilot for an organization called Symbol, and she can also summon the Kugai. After the war is over, he finds out that he's the clone of the original Yushiro that died 8 years ago in the first attempt to summon the Kugai. Now he and Miharu travel to the ancient land of Watanabe to rediscover their roots. Afterwards, he travels back to Tokyo to help his team in battling the US's all-out strike on Japan, and to rescue Miharu who's been kidnapped by Symbol.\nGasaraki is one of the greatest. Even if there are quite a few action scenes (like \n, the robots aren't the main focus: it's character development). They are beautifully portrayed. Technological stuff uses a lot of CGI which helps give it a realistic touch, nd the story is both exciting and spell-binding.

Then a major disaster which destroyed much of mankind known as the Chronoquake occurred. Mankind was thrown into chaos and much knowledge was lost until a moon appeared out of nowhere and brought back some of the knowledge with it. Fast forward to a few years later. The Transbaal empire has formed the Galaxy Angels to poke around ruins in search of the technology that was lost and to discover what it does. Once they have this \"lost technology\" they return to their base to figure out what it does. Usually this ends up in some mishap.\nLeading the team is \n, the gun-toting manic of the group. Another members is the sweet-and-lovable happy homemaker type \n, who is their newest member and does most of the cooking. \n usually schemes her way into trouble, and the other angels have to help her out. \n is a rabid cosplayer but hides it from the others. \n is a strictly religious person who rarely speaks on her own accord. One of the pieces of lost technology that they find is the computer Normad, a pocketbook-sized computer with a 10,000 ghz processor. He is placed in a stuffed toy that \n carries around. It will talk your ear off if you're not careful.\nAt this time a new series has been announced. Now, Galaxy Angel can be divided into two canons: the anime, and the game/manga series. The anime series is completely irreverent, with very little continuity to speak of, and something close to pure 100% comedy all over the place.\nThe game/manga series (which are generally the same in theme, if differing in plot flow and other details), however, is a more serious version, fleshing out the Angels and providing an actual plot, complete with antagonists. The game series itself was a trilogy, and while a number of anime-only characters aren't there (i.e. Volcott and Normad), they're replaced by even more game/manga-only characters, which I won't go into here. In any case, the 'new' series is not at all a continuation of the irreverent anime we know and love; instead, it will follow the plot of the NEW game series, Galaxy Angel II, complete with a new Angel Brigade; thus, it will probably be (more) serious in nature." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "April 7, 2001–Sept 29, 2001" ], "creator" : [ "Kanan, Broccoli" ], "company" : [ "Madhouse", "Broccoli", "Bandai Visual", "Broccoli" ], "title" : [ "Galaxy Angel", "Galaxy Angel Z", "Galaxy Angel A", "Galaxy Angel AA", "Galaxy Angel S", "Galaxy Angel X" ], "director" : [ "Morio Asaka, Yoshimitsu Ohashi", "Shigehito Takayanagi" ], "released" : [ "26 TV Episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/galaxy_angel/forte.htm", "name" : "Forte Stollen" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/galaxy_angel/vanilla.htm", "name" : "Vanilla H." }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/galaxy_angel/milfeulle.htm", "name" : "Milfeulle Sakuraba" }, { "name" : "Commander Volcott Huey" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/galaxy_angel/mint.htm", "name" : "Mint Blancmanche" }, { "name" : "Kokomo Perot" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/galaxy_angel/ranpha.htm", "name" : "Ranpha Franboise" }, { "name" : "Malibu Perot" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/galaxy_angel/takuto.htm", "name" : "Takuto Meyers" }, { "name" : "Normad" } ], "genre" : [ "Comedy", "Sci-Fi" ] } }

Those who became machines began to despise and look down on the true humans, and one (Count Mecha) took up hunting humans for a sport.\n's mother was the victim of just such a hunt. After that, the boy Tetsuro swore that he would avenge the death of his mother, and he knew of a way. If he could board the Galaxy Express 999 (aka three-nine), he could ride it to Andromeda, where they gave machine bodies for free. For he next several years, he lived with the orphans in the slums of Megalopolis City, waiting for his chance.\nHis chance comes. He steals a pass! But then, the police are after him. He is almost caught, but a strange woman (who strangely looked like his late mother) saved him.\nHer name is \n, and right away, \n sees something strange about her besides her appearance. She makes him an offer. She'll give back his pass if he takes her with him. He gladly agrees, and this begins one of the greatest adventures both in the galaxy and in the heart.\n\nBoth the movie and the TV series follow this strange pair as they ride the galactic rails and meet the many unusual people along the way. These strange visits ultimately cause Tetsuro to redefine his goal. For he sees in those machine bodies that which humans wish to avoid: greed, cruelty, or sadness. He realizes that it's the machine body that robs a person from his or her time limit, and that is what drives humanity into accomplishing what it does in such a limited lifespan. It is then that he vows to rid the universe of the accursed machine body that steals souls.\nTheir journey finally reaches \n's goal: Andromeda. It is there that \n discovers \n's dark secret. She is really the heiress to Queen Proethea's machine empire (the planet is named after her)! However, \n herself was hiding a secret from her mother: her father! He (embodied in energy in \n's pendant) had conspired under Promethea's nose (with \n helping) to destroy Andromeda. Though \n hesitates, \n seizes the chance. He helps \n get back on the Galaxy Express, and they escape to watch planet Maetel collapse.\nOnce \n returns to Earth, the two part ways (this is how the first GE999 movie ends) ...for a while. The remnants of the machine empire, however, remain, and \n finds herself returning to Earth to rejoin \n and finish the job. More adventure and more secrets await the pair as they once again ride the galactic rails.\nThe story of Galaxy Express 999 is one of a coming of age, where \n learns the many hard lessons of life and truly matures. He learns of the price of revenge, the reality and value of life and death, and that under that strange exterior may lie some rather rather dark or perhaps touching surprises, and that ultimately to go forward, one must let go of the past." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1978–81" ], "creator" : [ "Leiji Matsumoto" ], "company" : [ "Toei Animation" ], "title" : [ "Ginga Tetsudo 999" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/index.htm", "name" : "Uchu Kaizoku Kyaputen Harokku" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/index-arcadia.htm", "name" : "Waga Seishun No Arukadia" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/index-queen.htm", "name" : "Shin Taketori Monogatari Sennen Jo'oo" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/maetel_legend/index.htm", "name" : "Maetel Legend" } ], "released" : [ "113 TV episodes, 2 movies" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/antares.htm", "name" : "Boss Antares" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/tetsuro.htm", "name" : "Tetsuro Hoshino" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/harlock.htm", "name" : "Kyaputen Harokku" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/tochirou.htm", "name" : "Tochirou" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/claire.htm", "name" : "Claire" }, { "name" : "Count Mecha" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/conductor.htm", "name" : "Conductor" }, { "name" : "Faust" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/queen_emeraldas/emeraldas.htm", "name" : "Emeraldas" }, { "name" : "Metalmena" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/maetel.htm", "name" : "Maetel" }, { "name" : "Queen Promethea" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/captain_harlock/shadow.htm", "name" : "Shadow" }, { "name" : "Ryuzu" } ], "genre" : [ "Adventure", "Sci-Fi" ] } }

They decide to enter together when a couple of boys, \n and \n, tries to scare them by saying that the old school house is haunted by ghosts, but change their minds to go in and help after seeing \n. As they enter they are met by an evil spirit, \n, who chases after them trying to kill them while being terrorized by the other ghosts that inhabit the old school house.\nUpon hiding in the old principal's office the group discovers a book, the Ghost Diary, that was written by \n's mother long ago. They used the instructions in the book to put \n back to sleep in a huge tree that resides in the mountains. Afterwards, the group leaves the old school house only to learn that a lot of time has past since they've been in there. At first they were relieved and thought it was all over, but then \n states that the tree in the mountains was cut down a while ago, which brings up the question: if the tree is gone, where is \n? They immediately learn that the spell they casted went awry and sealed him in \n, \n's cat.\nThis event sets off a whole adventure where \n and friends band together to put all the other ghosts to sleep and watch over the now sealed \n, who know far more than he would tell about each ghost that appears." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct. 22, 2000–March 25, 2001" ], "creator" : [ "Hiroshi Hashimoto" ], "company" : [ "Studio Pierrot", "Fuji TV" ], "title" : [ "Gakkou No Kaidan", "School's Ghost Stories" ], "director" : [ "Noriyuki Abe" ], "released" : [ "19 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/amanojaku.htm", "name" : "Amanojaku" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/reo.htm", "name" : "Reo" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/hajime.htm", "name" : "Hajime" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/momoko.htm", "name" : "Momoko" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/kaya.htm", "name" : "Kaya" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/satsuki.htm", "name" : "Satsuki Miyanoshita" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gakkou_no_kaidan/keichiro.htm", "name" : "Keiichirou Miyanoshita" } ], "genre" : [ "Adventure", "Paranormal" ] } }

The universe that Gall Force encompasses spans many places, many times, and many characters, yet all are tied together by one theme.\nThe original story (which is taken to an alternate path in The Revolution) is first in the timeline. Two races are at war. On one side are the Solnoids, a female human-like race fighting for their continued survival. On the other side are the Paranoids, bio-mechanical cretures who seeks the Solnoids' total destruction. The crew of the Solnoid craft Star Leaf have been instructed to go to the planet Chaos for some strategic end. However, the Paranoids are in hot pursuit, and in the process begin a course of events between the two races that will have repercussions even after both races are gone. It will all come to a head on the planet Chaos, which orbits the planet that lives on its own. The Solnoids call it Terra. We call it Earth. The legacy will remain on that planet as the two races face their mutual fate at Sigma Narse.\n\nThe Earth Chapters are next in chronological order. Earth, 2085. As is realized by now, humanity is the legacy left by the Solnoids and Paranoids, and it seems that humanity is unfortunately following the ways of its ancestors, especially with the discovery of traces of the ancient technologies. Paranoid-like machines known as Cyberoids (or MMEs) now seek to destroy every human they can. The Earth Chapters follow one Sandy Newman as well as a resistance force on Mars, both set to take back their home. Rhea Gall Force immediately follows the aftermath of this titanic war, and while the Cyberoids hunt down what is left of humanity, one with the guilt of her father on her hands seeks a solution and salvation.\nNew Era takes the story forward again, to the year 2291, 200 years after the Cyberoid war, to the time of acropolis cities and yumans, the genetically-engineered superiors to normal humans. The line of battle between the yumans and the humans were drawn 50 years ago but was stopped. The battle, however, is about to start all over again, and an old enemy has resurfaced to join the battle. It will be humanity's most desparate struggle yet.\nA never-ending battle. Even as two races fight themselves to extinction, those who are their legacy seem to follow in their footsteps. Are we, the descendants of those two ancient races, destined to follow them on the path to extinction?\nThere are two things in common with virtually every Gall Force story. First is plain, hardcore war; war which precedes the known beginnings and which may continue past the known ends, part of the cycle of creation and destruction. Second is the focus on women. The spirit, personalities, and outright determination these women possess give them a special beauty that complements the natural beauty they also possess." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1986–97" ], "creator" : [ "Kenichi Sonoda" ], "company" : [ "Artmic", "MOVIC", "Polydor", "Sony Music" ], "title" : [ "Gall Force", "Gall Force Earth Chapters", "Rhea Gall Force", "Gall Force New Era", "Gall Force Revolution" ], "director" : [ "Katsuhito Akitama" ], "released" : [ "3 OVA episodes", "3 OVA episodes", "1 OVA episode", "2 OVA episodes", "4 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gall_force/rabby.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Soundy" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Skoa" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Sci-Fi" ] } }

However, once Sandy Frank's syndication license ran out, media mogul Ted Turner saw the potential in this series and G-Force returned to American airwaves... in a slightly different form. In \"G-Force, Guardians of Space,\" five young heroes protect the Earth from the evil alien computor, his gravel-voiced minion Gallactor, and their legions of green-suited terrorists. Gone were the space battles and \n, replaced by a more accurate translation of the original Gatchaman series--violence and all. Episodes previously left out by Sandy Frank as \"too risky\" were released. Some fans who might have recognized the faces from \n were now confused by the new names. It didn't help that the heroic team was called G-Force in both versions--is this the G-Force with \n and \n, or is this the G-Force with \n and \n? G-Force went on an initial trial run in 1986, but mysteriously disappeared after three episodes. It wasn't until the 1990s that the show made it onto the Cartoon Network and gained its own fan following.\nDue to the relaxed television standards of the late 1980s, more of the original violence was left uncut in \"G-Force.\" Episodes were more complete and less chopped up than \n. There are fewer silly excuses used to cover up violent scenes, giving the audience a little credit for intelligence. G-Force fans claim there is better interaction between the characters--especially \n and \n--than there was in \n. And there's no dippy robot narrator.\nVoice acting was lackluster, especially compared to what had been done in \n. The \"descriptive\" character names might have worked in the 1960s or in a less dramatic show, but are out of place in this series (\"Dr. Brighthead\"?). Original background music wasn't included in the original series package to Turner, so a horrible electronic disco backbeat needles the audience like Chinese water torture. We won't even mention the opening theme.\nI regret to say that I haven't watched much of the G-Force series. I don't have the patience. The names and the music make me wince, and if I have access to both this and the original Gatchaman series, I'd rather watch Gatchaman. However, I am happy the show was re-released and included more original footage", "In the near future, the world is menaced by a criminal organization known only as the Galactor Syndicate.

The compilation was mainly shown in New England in the early 1980's, with Danguard Ace airing on Mondays, Starvengers on Tuesdays, Spaceketeers on Wednesdays, Grandizer on Thursdays and Gaiking on Fridays.\nIn 1978, before Force Five reached American shores, Mattel released a popular series of toys called \"Shogun Warriors,\" which were based on the characters from the five Japanese cartoons. By the time Jim Terry Productions created Force Five to show the anime programs in the U.S., Mattel had lost the rights to the characters, leaving no toys available in America during the course of Force Five's run.\nThe syndicated anime package did, however, spark a revived interest in giant robot cartoons, paving the way for shows such as \n, \n and Gobots to find receptive American audiences.", "\nDanguard Ace (\"Planetary Robot\") centered around Earth's discovery of a new planet called Promete. Earth had become ravaged and almost uninhabitable due to overpopulation and a lack of natural resources, so a ship was sent to the remote outreaches of the solar system to explore the unspoiled Promete, which shared similarities with Earth's environment.\nUnfortunately, the evil scientist Komisar Krell also discovered Promete, and he planned to move his own people onto the planet. After Krell attacked the first Earth ship journeying to Promete, the Earthlings built Danguard Ace to protect them from future assaults.\nDanguard Ace had some parallels to the sci-fi classic Star Wars, focusing on a conflict between the good son and bad father. The hero of the story, Lieutenant Winstar, was the son of a great pilot whom he believed was dead. But in fact, Winstar's father was a prisoner of the evil Krell, who controlled the pilot's mind through a mask. Like Darth Vader, Winstar's father hid his true identity, taking instead the pseudonym Captain Mask.", "\nStarvengers was another robot show, this one starring three robots that fought another evil empire (the Pandemonium Empire with Colonel Fuerer). The Starvenger robotsStar Dragon, Star Arrow and Star Poseidonwere created to combat the Pandemonium Empire, which sought to (what else?) take over the Earth.\nOne strange aspect of Starvengers was its villain, Colonel Fuerer (or possibly Captain Fuerer, or Fuhrer), the commander in charge of getting rid of the Starvengers. Like his name implied, Fuerer was an Adolf Hilter caricature, complete with a bad German accent, Nazi uniform, and weirdest of all, two horns protruding from his head.", "\nSpaceketeers followed the adventures of Princess Aurora and her band of protectors as they tried to accomplish a dangerous mission for their Empress. An evil energy source from the star system of Dekos caused the once-peaceful creatures of the universe to change into evil mutants. The Empress enlisted Aurora and three spaceketeers to find and destroy the energy source.\nAurora had her hands full with one of her cohorts: Jesse Dart, a super-powerful but arrogant spaceketeer who followed his own whims. The other two spaceketeers, portly Porkos and intelligent Arimos, were based on the characters or Porthos and Aramis from The Three Musketeers.\nSpaceketeers is an adaptation of the classic Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\" Which chronicles Buddhist monk Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain sacred texts. Princess Aurora represents Xuanzang.\nJesse Dart represents the monkey king Sun Wukong who rebels against heaven and is trapped under a mountain by Buddha for his transgressions. He possesses enormous strength, is skilled at fighting and has a staff that weighs 8,100 kilograms. He is released from his prison in order to aid Xuanzang in his pilgrimage.\nAramos represents Sha Wujing who is also referred to (in English) as Sand or Sandy. Wujing was a general of heaven who broke a vase in a fit of rage and was sent to Earth as punishment to be reincarnated as a sand demon. As part of his punishment seven swords would fly down from heaven to stab him in the chest and as a result he had to live in the river in order to avoid them.\nPorcos represents Zhu Bajie also referred to (in English) as Pigsy or Pig. Bajie was also a disgraced heavenly marshall who was exiled to Earth after a drunken attempt to get fresh with the Goddess of the Moon. He was sentenced to a thousand lives that all ended in a love tragedy. When sent to Earth he fell down a pig well and was reincarnated as a man eating pig. While his other fellow pilgrims become enlightened on the way, he remains a creature of base desires. Unlike his fellow pilgrims who become Buddhas as a reward, Bajie is rewarded with all the leftovers he can eat.", "\nGrandizer starred \n, a.k.a. \n. \n was seemingly the sole survivor of the planet Antares, which had been destroyed by Vega the Strong's flying saucer squad. Spearheading the attack was the great battle robot Grandizer, which Vega hoped to use to help him bring the entire universe under his rule. But that crafty \n stole back Grandizer and took it to Earth, where he hid the robot and assumed a human identity.\n fought evil all on his own and was a very popular hero from the Force Five series. Like Superman, he had dual identities and hailed from an alien planet, which gave him greater strength and agility than his human counterparts. And also like Superman, \n spent a lot of his time saving hapless humans from the clutches of Vega the Strong and his henchmen.", "\nGaiking chronicled Earth's struggle against a looming invasion by the people of the planet Zala, which was about to be swallowed by a black hole. Desperate to maintain their civilization, the leaders of Zala made plans to secretly overtake Earth for their preservation.\nA few Earth people caught onto the invasion and built a powerful robot called Gaiking, their only hope to protect themselves. The Gaiking Super Dragon was piloted by Ares Astronopolis, a former major league pitcher who now used his telekinetic abilities to fight evil." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1977", "; 1975", "; 1976", "; 1978", "; 1975" ], "title" : [ "Wakusei Robo Dangard A", "UFO Robot Grandizer", "Daiku Maryu", "SF Saiyuki Starzinger", "Getter Robo", "Getter Robo G" ], "company" : [ "Toei Animation" ], "released" : [ "56 TV eps.", "; 74 TV eps.", "; 44 TV eps.", "; 64 TV eps.", "; 90 TV eps." ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/force_five/brenda.htm", "name" : "Hikaru Makiba" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/force_five/orion.htm", "name" : "Duke Fleed" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Mecha" ] } }

As a way of injecting new life into the still-popular franchise (which had since seen movies and sequels), Bandai (who had acquired Sunrise) decided to let new talent branch out the concept of \"Gundam\" and create alternate universes, creating new Gundam stories. Masashi Ikeda's \n and its resutling offshoots may be the most recognizable, but \n was the first. Created by Yasuhiro Imagawa, the mind behind \n, this is a series that doesn't seem altogether straightforward, and it doesn't fit the mold in terms of the mecha genre (that's Imagawa's style), but it's still a fascinating series in itself.\nSixty years ago, colonization in outer space began in a desperate move to escape the Earth's wrecked environment. Eventually, the rich and affluent moved to those space colonies, abandoning the Earth to the pitiful wretches left behind. They declared a new period, the Fighter Century, and declared that every 4 years the fate of the earth would be decided in a Gundam Fight tournament. Each nation would have a Gundam with which to fight and a champion to pilot it and represent his/her nation. The nation whose Gundam won the tournament would then become ruler of the Earth... until the next tournament.\n\nThe Gundam Fight has seven basic rules:\nSo now, the latest Gundam Fight tournament has begun... but with a new twist. \n, the fighter from Neo-Japan, has come with two missions: to win, and to learn the truth about his brother, \n.\nIncidentally, the calendar is how you can determine in which universe a Gundam story resides. If it's UC (Universal Century), it's the original Gundam universe. If it's AC (After Colony), it's the Wing universe. And if it's FC (Fighter Century), it's G Gundam.", "G Gundam is the first of the Alternate Gundam Universes, and has the reputation for being one of the wildest too. Created by Yasuhiro Imagawa (\n), G Gundam presents a vastly different take on the Gundam saga.\nTaking place in Year 60 of the Future Century, the colonies are about to hold the 13th annual Gundam Fight. The Gundam Fight is a tournament created by the Shuffle Alliance and held every 4 years by the colonies (each representing a different country) and are used in order to avoid War. Each colony/country uses their own respective Gundam and Gundam Fighter to represent their country. The Gundam Fighters fight on until the last one is remaining, winning the country's right to rule over the colonies for the next 4 years. The tournament is held on Earth, where most of the planet was wrecked by previous Gundam Fights and those left on Earth are forced to live under the foot of the wealthy population on the colonies.\nG Gundam focuses on Neo Japan fighter \n, who hopes to win the tournament with his Shining Gundam. However, this isn't his only purpose. \n is also on a quest to find his missing brother \n, who escaped to Earth with the Devil Gundam (Dark Gundam in the Dub), a technological nightmare that could ultimately spell humanity's annihilation. Traveling with his assistant \n, \n meets and fights various opponents (some of which become allies and will share the same destiny as \n) while tracking down his brother and the Devil Gundam. However, the influence and danger of the Devil Gundam is growing, and failure could ultimately spell humanity's doom.

Such is the case of this character created by the legendary Ozamu Tezuka, who has also created \n and \n.\n commands millions of dollars for his services, but those in need of his services gladly pay him. But he also has a detective's curiosity and instincts... especially with the theories of cause and effect, which is going to come in handy.\nAround the world, a phenomenon known as \"super humans\" is having its effects... humans with extraordinary abilities are catching the attention of others. But how these individuals came into the world is a mystery onto itself. The detective doctor must somehow find out what is behind these super-humans... and why.", "The anime \n was based off of Tezuka Osamu's manga.\nIt is about surgeon who is able to bend the laws of medical science so he can save the world from an alien race who are known as 'Super Humans.' At first it starts out as a man without a license in medicine of any sort, but his strange, yet amazing abilities help him save humans as a last resort. An effect of this is always growing wealth with the reputation that he is a god of medicine or something similar to that.\nDuring one of the World Olympics held in Atlantis (not the sunken island), a group of 'Super Humans' join and win everything better than any-one else could even dream of. Soon the 'Super Humans' start to take over all of the world and are starting to rule over humans. Then a strange woman starts to call him. She doesn't leave her name of medical history with him, so he doesn't call her back about something very bad that is to happen.\nThen a fourteen year old girl Black Jack operated on two years ago dies from her internal organs that aged to ninety years old. More strange things like that happen to humans. Finally, it is discovered the humans are being killed by the 'Super Humans.' So it becomes Black Jack's duty to study all about these 'Super Humans' in his laboratory, without very many people knowing, so he can restore Earth to the way it was before the 'Super Humans' came, and give hope back to man and womankind.\nBlack Jack is a man with white hair, and black hair ponytail on the left side of his head. He has a stitched scar next to his white cyburn on his right side of his face. There is another stitched scar starting in the center top of his forehead that smoothly curves over to the bottom left half of his jawbone. His mother died when he was very little, most likely before he was ten. The little girl with the red hair is his daughter named Pinoko. Pinoko is his assistant even though she is younger than ten.\nI have only seen this in Japanese, and as a TV show, and I can't understand very many words. The movie was released in English, Portuguese, and Japanese during the year of 1996. The movie is an hour and one half. Hiroshi Fujioka plays Black Jack in Japanese. The series may come into America and other continents in a few years. The director of the movie was Osamu Dezaki. The movie was rated four out of five stars. The movie only had VHS dubs so the names of characters' voices is hard to find out. There are 61 episodes in the TV show.\nIn order used by the show, the opening three songs are \"Gekkouka\" by Janne Da Arc; \"Here I am\" by Globe; and \"Fantastic\" by Ami Suzuki. The three ending themes are \"Kuroge Wagyuu Joushio Tanyaki Roppyaku Hachijuu En\" by Ai Ohtsuka; \"Clover\" by Hiro; and \"Careless Breath\" by EXILE. The first ending theme, and starting theme are from episode 1 - 28.

There are many \"outpost\"/settlement worlds in the galaxy, with heavy western influenced names, such as \"Planet Uma\" and \"Planet Durango\". Oddly enough, most of these worlds have only humanoid lifeforms on them. Not many aliens encountered.\nIt's not often that two themes are melded together so perfectly. In \"Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs\", the themes of the Old West, and the new themes of Science Fiction and Space Travel are combined together so smoothly, so consistently, so special, that you wonder why can't all the newer animated TV series today be this good? The music even fits the western overtone theme and the mood of the stories, so there is the real feeling of the Old Frontier West (think Clint Eastwood), even though the series is set in the future, but not-that-distant end of the 21st century.\nMarc Handler, the animated TV series writer behind both \"Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs\", as well as \"\n\" (the immediate predecessor to this newer series), cleaned up all the weak flaws in the look and style of that story format, and imbued it with even better characters and story plot elements than ever before. In the arc of the stories for \"Saber Rider\", the events are more character driven, and less dependent on what the enemy wants to do next. Unlike the characters in \"\n\", who were pretty much left to fend for themselves, the Star Sheriffs in \"Saber Rider\" are more mobile across the galaxy, and have ample logistical support, and provide a wide range of superb interaction with each other, in each of their stories. A sense of teamwork, family, and unity for a cause, that of defending the New Frontier, so that mankind can settle and explore space in peace.\nThroughout the length of the series, you get the feeling that \n himself, is relaying his log of events to the us, the viewer audience. Each episode begins with the title being displayed, and Saber doing an opening monologue, talking about their whereabouts and current assignments given to them from Cavalry Command. The wrap up for each episode has Saber summing up whatever valuable lesson can be learned from the danger they just faced.\nStar Sheriffs are duly-deputized special operatives of Cavalry Command, Earth's space-going law enforcement arm and defense patrol organization out in space, and along the New Frontier. They are in essence,pan- galactic government marshalls, with broad powers of authority, as well as having to serve as galactic frontier ambassadors of goodwill to other sovereign worlds out there in space. The open handed gesture of forming an alliance with other worlds is always extended, perhaps much like counties the Old West. Other than their wits, their courage, and their standard issue equipment, such as their blaster pistols, and RAMROD's array of electronics, they have no superpowers unto themselves. When they do battle with the Outriders, it's a futuristic version of the code of the Old West.\nIt must be noted that the Star Sheriffs wear futuristic protective suits, since they traverse space (as easy as we drive around town), and have a few space-aged land rovers and air vehicles with them at all times. In fact, \n's own personal horse Steed, is actually a highly advanced mechanical robot horse that can fly, like a mythical pegasus, only mechanized. There is also no lack of space vessels or computers in this series, and the city architecture that is shown on the developed human Frontier worlds is truly excellent.\nThe RAMROD was created to be Cavalry Command's answer to combat the growing threat from giant enemy Renegade Units being used by certain cells of the Outriders. RAMROD is primarily our heroes' large starship, but can convert into a giant 250' high robot weapon that can fist-fight even better than \"John Wayne\" (with his voice too), whenever it's required, or whenever an Outrider Renegade Unit pops up, practically out of nowhere, looking for a real knock-down drag-out fight.\nIt's really outstanding to see the Star Sheriffs work as a team, to operate RAMROD, the actual star of \"Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs\".\nHowever, 90% of the time, RAMROD is utilized in his \"Vehicle mode\", and not in his \"Challenge Phase mode\". If you value the USS Enterprise on Star Trek, you'll appreciate RAMROD just as much! RAMROD is not a sentient robot, anymore than the USS Enterprise is sentient starship. RAMROD fights almost all of his battles on land, and there was even one underwater!\nMuch of RAMROD's armament consists of lethal high energy beam weapons, designed to engage the enemy Renegade Unit long enough, until the trusty \"Maverick Quick-Draw\" disintegrator beam/weapons array can be brought to bear against the hopefully, weakened enemy unit. It's not always he same outcome though, because these Renegade Units are getting tougher, and come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. \"The good, the bad, and the ugly\". The question of whether or not Cavalry Command plans to build anymore RAMROD equalizer units is never explored, and it certainly begs to be answered." ], "jp_info" : { "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/saber_rider/april.htm", "name" : "Marian Ruwell" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/saber_rider/colt.htm", "name" : "Bill Wilcox" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/saber_rider/fireball.htm", "name" : "Shinji Hikari" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/saber_rider/jesse.htm", "name" : "Perios" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/saber_rider/nemesis.htm", "name" : "Hyuza" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/saber_rider/saber.htm", "name" : "Richard Lancelot" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "dates" : [ "1984" ], "company" : [ "Studio Pierrot" ], "title" : [ "Sei Jushi Bismarck", "Bismarck the Star Musketeers" ] } }

into an anime series in 1992 by \n, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon (Translation: Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon) is probably the most famous \"Magical Girl\" story on either side of the water. The story of \n and her Sailor Soldiers has drawn one of the largest fan bases for any single story, extending well beyond its intended young girl audience. Formally introduced to the United States in the fall of 1996 by DiC Entertainment, the series has only grown in American popularity (although it had its critics and a false start early into its running).\nThe story is primarily about a young teenage girl with a unique hairstyle named \n [\n - literally \"rabbit\"] \n. At first glance, this bumbling, boy-crazy, lackadaisical crybaby of a girl would be the LAST girl you'd expect to be granted a magical transformation brooch by a talking black cat with a crescent moon on its forehead (Luna didn't believe it, either). What we discover is that under this wacky exterior is a very kind, caring, loving...and protective girl who can possess the will and determination to stand up and fight against anything the forces of evil can throw at her.\nThe story follows her and the friends (and allies) she gains along the way in her continuing mission to defend the Earth from evils, and it is divided into five separate series.\n (originally 46 episodes, however 2 episodes were cut for controversial content, 3 cut for timing, and the last 2 merged into 1 for both reasons for a total American release of 40 episodes) pits the Sailor Scouts against \n and the Negaverse [Dark Kingdom], which seeks revenge on a failed attack on the Moon Kingdom during the Silver Millennium 1000 years ago. This is also the crazy beginning of the relationship between \n and \n [\n] \n, whom she originally detests but eventually discovers is her long-lost lover and Prince of the Earth when she herself was Princess of the Moon Kingdom.\n (R meaning Romance, 43 episodes, with 1 non-critical episode cut for a total American release of 42 episodes) is itself in two pieces. The first part features two aliens and an energy-dependent alien tree. This only runs for 13 episodes and sets the stage for the real story of Sailor Moon R. It focuses around two things: \n [\n], a little pink-haired Serena lookalike who literally dropped out of the sky, and a family of time-traveling enemies out to stop \n and alter the future to their end. Late in the series, we learn that \n (aka Small Lady) is the future daughter of \n and \n, who will rule the Earth together into a new age of peace. What is interesting is that the American release of Sailor Moon was abruptly stopped in the middle of this series and was not continued until loyal fans demanded that Sailor Moon R be finished. DiC finally relented and completed Sailor Moon R.\nOn a side note, Sailor Moon began its American life syndicated. However, the abrupt halt of the series at 65 episodes promptly dropped support and eventually caused syndication to cease in 1997 (the same year Sailor Moon completed its final series in Japan, at 200 episodes). \n acquired the presentation rights after a hiatus of almost a year. However, it barely completed two runs before a scheduling change pulled all cartoons from its lineup, effectively putting Sailor Moon in the dark again. However, soon afterward, \n began its innovative high-intensity cartoon block known as Toonami. To help inject new material into the network, it acquired the rights to present two more anime series on its network. \n was one. Sailor Moon was the other. The acquisition was a mutual success. Popularity for the entire block soared, and Sailor Moon fans were overjoyed once again. Furthermore, a deal was made to bring the missing episodes of Sailor Moon R, which were at the time restricted to release on Canada's YTV, to \n and finally put some closure on the matter. Eventually, the block of 82 episodes were released into syndication, where they remain today. Then, in early 2000, there was a surprise. Toei, through its American subsidiary (Cloverway, Inc.), began work on the rest of the Sailor Moon episodes and worked together with Pioneer Entertainment to release the three Sailor Moon movies to home video.\n (S meaning Super, 38 episodes) introduces two unique Sailor Soldiers to the mix: \n and \n. Together with \n (who we first saw in Sailor Moon R), they present Sailor Moon with two sets of problems: dealing with the Bureau of Bad Behavior [Death Busters], which is seeking the pure of heart to erase the world, and dealing with the Outer Sailor Soldiers, who put the mission objective before the life of the victim and put the Sailor Soldiers' moral foundation to the test.\n (39 episodes) turns the focus from \n to little \n and the pursuit of dreams as an enemy from the hidden past (the Dead Moon Circus) returns during a total solar eclipse, bent on revenge against the joyful people of Earth and intent on spoiling everyone's dreams by finding the one called Pegasus, who is hiding in \n's dreams.\nAs of present, this is where the American release of Sailor Moon stops. There is currently no word on whether or not Cloverway will proceed into the final series. However, it is assumed that public reaction to Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon Super Super S will affect the decision.\n (33 episodes, not yet released in America) is the last Sailor Moon series. Everyone is brought back together, and three new warriors appear that are even more unusual then \n and \n. Furthermore, one last mystery appears to top off the greatest fight in the Sailor Soldiers' lives.", "Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon is about a girl named \n (\n) who soon meets a talking cat.

Thankfully, a group of five warriors (known as Vandel Busters) called the Zenon Warriors are there to protect the hometown of Beet, our main character. I'm not sure what all of the other towns do... or maybe they just don't matter. At any rate, Beet is a young boy that dreams of becoming a Vandel Buster, yet the Zenon Warriors always shut him down, saying he's just a kid... which he is. But he's drinking his milk, eating his vegetables, and working out on his Ab-lounger, as he's bound and determined to fight monsters for a living, and \"end this century of darkness\".\nSo everything is all hunky-dory until one day a powerful Vandel comes knocking on the town's door... and as typical the Zenon Warriors answer. But this time, Beet shows up to watch, and ends up getting mortally wounded. Dumb kid. Now the five Vandel Busters must give up their life force energy in order for Beet to survive. Way to go kid... see what happens when you don't listen? But now Beet not only has the power of five powerful warriors inside him, he has the drive and determination to use that power to rid the Earth of Vandels so that no one else will have to suffer because of them. Okay, but first he needs to practice a bit....\n\nThree years later, nobody has seen or heard from Beet. Beet's childhood friend (and possible future wife), Paola, has grown into a Vandel Buster and protects the village. But then a 2-star Vandel called Mugine of the Black Bog starts making life miserable for the townsfolk. Although Paola doesn't quite have what it takes to face off against a 2-star Vandel, she goes for it anyway. I know it's hard to just sit by and not do anything, but c'mon here, who is gonna protect the village if you go and get yourself killed, young lady!? Thankfully, after three years of being off training, Beet decides to come back, and helps her out of the jam. Despite being a lower level Vandel Buster than Paola, Beet makes mincemeat out of the baddies like they were nothing but pesky insects.\nThe artwork and animation seems pretty good for a TV show. There were a lot of scenes with cool poses and lighting that I thought would make for some cool posters or wall scrolls or desktop wallpapers. I checked out the \n website but they didn't seem to have any wallpapers available yet. Hopefully that will be coming soon.\nThe first DVD release, \n, contains the first four episodes in the series (\n, \n, \n, and \n), presented in both English and Japanese with optional subtitles. While the English dubbing for some of the characters is pretty good, for other characters it just sounds more like someone trying to do a voice rather than an actual, real voice. Mostly I noticed this about the smaller roles, such as random townsfolk. It kind of reminded me of the old \n series. But I also do understand it, as it's not like TV shows have an unlimited budget to work with (although this was released on DVD, it was clearly produced as a TV series). I'm just really glad they were able to include the original Japanese dialog track on the DVD. And both my wife and I are really looking forward to viewing more episodes as to see where this story is going.\nIllumitoon Entertainment, Ltd. announced that based on overwhelming demand it will be initiating a trade-in program for its \"dubtitled\" DVDs. \"Dubtitles\" are video with the English dialogue superimposed over Japanese audio, as opposed to true Japanese translations of the Japanese audio.\n\"It's something that's obviously very important to the fans, and we want to give them what they want,\" said Barry Watson, President/CEO of Illumitoon. \"Going forward we want to incorporate literal translations on all our anime product.\"\nThe trade-in program is only available through Illumitoon's website, and will not be available through retailers. Details are available at \n. The trade-in offer applies to all Illumitoon DVDs released before April 30, 2007, specifically:\nBoBoBo-Bo BoBoBo - Bo-nafide Protector of Hair\n\nBeet the Vandel Buster - The Sacrifice\n\nB't X - Empire of the Machines\n\"We're always listening to our fans, and are extremely grateful for their input,\" said Watson. \"I think fans will be very pleased.\"\nIllumitoon is offering the trade-in program through 5/30/2007.

It aired on Nick until 1990. It aired in the early morning.\nThe story was about a young boy named Sebastian, and a large white Great Pyrenee dog named Belle. Sebastian had been raised by an old man named Cecil and had never seen his mother. His mother had given birth to him after Cecil rescued him, and had left, promising to return someday. She was a gypsy lady and also worked for a traveling carnival.\nBelle was a large white dog who lived in the mountains, and was believed to be evil. In reality Belle was gentle, but only Sebastian knew it. He had apparently been blamed for some bad things that had happened in the town that Sebastian lived in, which was located near the Pyrenes Mountains of France. It is through these mountains that Belle and Sebastian have all their great adventures.\nSebastian is about 11 or 12 or so, and begins to wonder what happened to his mother. Cecil tells him about her, and he decides to go and look for her. At first Marie, who is his aunt (?) will not allow it, but eventually he leaves anyway with Belle and a small dog he carries in his pocket named Poochie. They travel all over the Mountains, and nearly find his mother on several occasions. They are pursued by a Lieutenant (or Inspector) Garcia, who wants to capture Belle. They also encounter a girl named Sara, who makes two appearances in the story.\nEventually Sebastian finds his mother who I believe was in a cave near where the story had started. Her name was Isobelle. She states that Sebastian's father had been a French (?) painter, and she had broken gypsy code by marrying outside the culture. She also says that Sebastian's father died before he was born.\nIsobelle was very sick, however, so Sebastian needed to find a doctor badly. He ties a letter explaining the situation around Belle's neck and sends him to the village for help. Marie is engaged to the doctor who comes to Isobelle's aid, and Isobelle recovers. This action by Belle proves to everyone he was not the \"White Monster\" (as they called him).\nAfter being reunited with his mother, Sebastian receives a visit from his friend Sarah and her father. It turns out that Sarah's father had actually known Isabel in the past. It looked like Isabel and Sara's father were gonna hook up (which I always thought was weird because I sensed a romantic thing going on with Sebastian and Sara and that would create some weird thing with their respective parents becoming a couple or getting married).\nOn the final episode Marie marries the doctor, and Cecil, Isobelle, Sebastian, Belle, and Poochie all live happily together." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1981" ], "title" : [ "Meiken Jolly" ], "company" : [ "MK Company", "Visual 80", "Toho" ], "released" : [ "52 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Adventure", "Coming of Age" ] } }

Fans followed the adventures of G-Force, five young orphans augmented with cerebonic implants: the heroic leader \n, hot-headed \n, beautiful \n, stuttering kid-clone \n and Space Burger-scarfing \n. Assisted by their \"robot guardian,\" \n, G-Force flew their warship, the Phoenix, to faraway planets and battled evil armies from Planet Spectra with superpowered tricks like the \"Whirlwind Pyramid\" and the \"Fiery Phoenix.\" The 70's-era fashions and phrases (\"big ten\", \"hang loose\") make the show a retro favorite today.\nOf all the versions, Battle of the Planets, with its big-budget production and enthusiastic staff, hooked the most international fans. The only drawback to the show was that even the youngest viewers were able to see through certain kidvid cop-outs: All the battles on \"other worlds\" looked like they took place on Earth (where they actually did in Gatchaman). There were obvious differences between the original animation and the segments added in America (the \"ready room\" scene, shots of the Phoenix flying through space, etc.). And all those \"robot planes\" had suspiciously human-looking pilots.\nThis coverup wasn't all bad: the suspicion that there was more to Battle of the Planets made the show even more interesting. Why didn't we get to see \n fight very much? Were there some special scenes we were missing? Why did \n make those funny noises? Some of us kids saw past the explanation that \n was a test tube experiment and guessed that the original character just had a lot to say, maybe some of it even naughty. (We were right!)\nThe professional voice cast and superb new music score made the show fun to watch and set the ultimate standard for dubbed Japanese animation. Sandy Frank put over $5 million into production of this series, and it shows. In order to reduce the amount of violence in the show, some episodes were dissected and substituted with poor-quality animation and lame excuses (\"Don't worry, kids. All the injured and dying bystanders you see here are only robots.\" And what truly happened to \n's father, anyway?). As much as ten minutes of the program was taken up by the prattling of \n and his friends.\n\nBattle of the Planets was the show that started it all; the show that introduced most Western fans to Gatchaman and to Japanese animation in general. (Tezuka's \n and \n ran in the mid-60s and early 70s, but it was Battle of the Planets that started the anime ball rolling.) It's only too easy to villify Sandy Frank for all the cuts that were made to this show, but to be perfectly honest, Sandy Frank was only responsible for seeing potential in Gatchaman, hiring a staff to do the conversion and marketing the result. The producer Frank hired, Jameson Brewer, worked an extremely tight schedule (one episode a week) with few to no resources (no scripts, just the Japanese episodes \"as is\"), under heavy limitations. If you think about it, the censors are truly to blame--anyone who had to butt heads with Action for Children's Television in the mid seventies will know just how exasperating it is to put out any kind of animated entertainment. On the other hand, we have a lot to thank Sandy and his staff for. They invested a great deal of money and effort in the production of Battle of the Planets; hired professional actors (some who truly enjoyed working on the show), writers and composers, and sold this show \"like the second coming.\" Few other animated productions (including the subsequent dubs of Gatchaman: \n and \n) have been able to match the quality due to tighter budgets and...I don't know, lack of \"the right stuff.\" Personally, this is my favorite dubbed version, and has accounted for many happy childhood hours in front of the TV.", "In the near future, the world is menaced by a criminal organization known only as the Galactor Syndicate.

Set sometime in the future, three new students to Saint Ignacio's School for Girls must now decide which school club they would like to join. The most obvious choice would be the Debutante club, helped by president Sayka Kitaouji, as that's the club that every other new student dreams of joining. Just about everyone who gains membership eventually goes on to great status, but the line for applicants is insanely long, and very few every get accepted. But our three girls are looking at an alternative, the Etiquette Club, led by president Reika Ayanokouji along with vice-president of the club Rie Shibusawa. The Etiquette Club is the complete opposite of the Debutante club in that very few people ever even apply for membership. In fact, the current membership consists of only Reika and Rie.\n\nThe three potentials of the Etiquette club are Saori Tachibana, Shihoko Sakaki, and Kanami Izaki. Saori and Shihoko were already friends before starting at St. Ignacio's, and it's at an assembly that they both met Kanami. Earlier in the day, Shihoko became instantly infatuated with Rie during their brief encounter, so she definitely wants to join Rie's club. Saori, being Shihoko's friend, agrees to go along with her, while Kanami seems to have her own reasons for wanting the join. So together, all three enter the door to club building... only to be greeted by arrows flying right toward them. Saori and Kanami easily avoid or deflect the arrows, but unfortunately Shihoko takes one right to the forehead. Fortunately, the arrows were tipped with suction cups. Unfortunately, the arrows were a test, and Shihoko failed.\n\nSo Saori passed and made membership, even though she didn't want it, while Shihoko failed to become a member, even though she really wanted it. Anyone see a solution coming? Yep, Saori agrees to be a member if they also make Shihoko a member. Vice-president Rie objects, but president Reika accepts, and thus the extremely unpopular Etiquette club now has a total of five members. We find that this number holds some sort of significance, as Rie lets slip some comment about it, but we're not told precisely what. Ah, but don't worry there friends! You all know that we're going to be finding out really, really soon! Plus we also learn during this conversation that Kanami Izaki is actually an extremely talented young lady that could have easily been at the top and made it into the Debutante club. So why exactly did she choose this club...?\n\nLater that evening we find our three new recruits sneaking around the building, searching for the secret of the club. They soon find it. With the touch of a hidden button, the whole room begins to change. The floor begins to move downward, taking them to a completely metallic room, with five numbered tubes set into the wall. A quick peek by Shihoko into one of the tubes activates a suction that pulls her right in, and closes it up. Unsure of what to do, Saori and Kanami each take a tube and follow her down. During the journey, their clothes are magically replaced by some kind of skin-tight uniforms. The end of the tubes spit them out into robotic vehicles called Battle Skipper Multipurpose Robot Vehicles (MRV). So it seems the secret of the club is that it's actually just a front for the Ex-Stars, a group of fine young ladies that uses extremely sophisticated robotic combat vehicles to help protect the world.\n\nAnyway, the girls surmise that Reika and Rie are in trouble, and take off to help. At the end of the conflict, two things are clear: the new recruits definitely have the drive and desire to become full Ex-Stars, and the new recruits need a lot of training! But don't worry, if anyone can whip these recruits into shape it's Rie. The only question is can she do it in time to face off against their most powerful foes to date, a new military model MRV that packs a ton of firepower. Oh yeah, and did I mention that mastermind behind the plot to take down the Ex-Stars is none other than the president of the Debutante club, Sayka Kitaouji?

In order to protect the commoners, warriors known as Sorcerer Hunters roam Spooner Continent serving punishment where it is due.\nEven stanger than the cases they take on, the Hunter's themselves seem to have their own agenda. \n, the appointed leader, would rather chase women than Sorcerers. His teammates, \n and \n, aren't what they seem to be. By day these two sisters appear to be somewhat charming young ladies and by night their demeanor changes completely into two in control dominatrix sisters. Along with \n's younger and prettier brother and the muscle bound \n, thus completes of warriors out to overcome evil Sorcerers and \n's overactive libido.\nThe first thirteen episodes are the expected lighthearted comedic adventures of the characters. The normal pattern is involved where the goddess-like being, \n, assigns the hunters a mission and they accept. During these missions, however justice is often lower on \n's list of things to do as he'd rather chase women. This causes grief from the Misu sisters and embarrassment for \n. The second thirteen episodes turns more serious as \n's \"Zoanthrope\" becomes a greater issue.

However, the story behind Cutey Honey is actually very interesting. Created by Go Nagai, reputed for incorporating suggestive elements into his works, the original Cutey Honey can be considered the precursor to the \"Magical Girl\" anime and manga genre, being the first featuring a female character able to transform and fight the forces of evil.\nThe story focuses around \n, who had thought she was normal until her \"father\" revealed to her that she was in fact an android with the capability to reshape her body in any number of ways. From that day on, \n fights against forces that would want her secret power for themselves.\nThe original Cutey Honey series (targeted as a shounen or boy-oriented series) ran for 25 episodes but was canceled when the Japanese public criticized its content. It was too overt. There are some things even the Japanese don't like to see on television. In 1992, an updated OVA version of the story (the video format and the changing attitudes made this approach more acceptable) came out. We see it here as New Cutey Honey.\nCutey Honey F (more commonly referred to by the full name, Cutey Honey Flash) is a retake of the original story (created by Yukako Iisaka) with an intent to make it shoujo (girl-oriented), turning \n from a well-endowed secretary android into a school-age human girl and adding both more romantic potential into the series as well as conflicts more typical of the genre that the original inspired, actually replacing \n (which finished just before Cutey Honey F began) as the show to watch." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1973", ", 1994", " , 1997" ], "creator" : [ "Go Nagai", "Yukako Iisaka" ], "company" : [ "Toei Animation", "Dynamic", "TV Asahi" ], "title" : [ "Kyuuteii Hanii", "Cutey Honey", "New Cutey Honey", "Cutey Honey Flash" ], "released" : [ "25 TV episodes", "8 OVA episodes", "39 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/cutey_honey/honey.htm", "name" : "Honey Kisaragi" }, { "name" : "Panther Zora" }, { "name" : "Adonis" }, { "name" : "Prince Zera" }, { "name" : "Akakabu Hayami" }, { "name" : "Seiji Hayami" }, { "name" : "Chokei Hayami" }, { "name" : "Seira Hazuki" }, { "name" : "Daigo Hayami" }, { "name" : "Sister Jill" }, { "name" : "Dr. Kisaragi" }, { "name" : "The Twilight Prince" }, { "name" : "Grandpa Danbei" } ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Ecchi" ] } }

The erotic scenes generally fall into either the straight or lesbian category, though one or two also delve into futanari (or hermaphroditism). Some of the episodes (like the popular Ami series) comprised parts of running stories while others are one-shots. The original series of 16 episodes ran for three years and was quickly followed by another 9. Various specials not considered part of the series in general ran until 1993. The series still attracts followers for its surreal stories, variety, and good stories (for the genre). Two spinoff series: New Century Cream Lemon and Cream Lemon New Generation, have brought the series to the 21st century.\nCream Lemon and New Cream Lemon were released on VHS and LaserDisc. Various episodes and the volumes released since 2000 have been released on DVD. A few of the Cream Lemon episodes were brought to the US by adult film distributor Excalibur Films under varying titles.\nAn interesting note for those interested in anime history: the popular Project A-ko series was originally slated to be a more-erotic story and made into an episode for Cream Lemon.

After a number of early disasters, Astral Gate technology was perfected. Finally able to realistically approach the speed of light, the asteroid belt and beyond came within reach, and a new era of frontier expansion began.\nBut just like in the Old West of the past, among the first to head out are the dregs of society: crooks, drug pushers, hackers, and so on. At the same time, however, there was also another type of person: one who roamed the ranges looking for whatever was there to take. Taking another page from the Old West, they called themselves Cowboys. The year is now 2071, and the Cowboys are out on the range.\n is the story of the Cowboy starship \n as it be-bops its way through the solar system, hunting heads and making do in the wild reaches of space where anything can happen. Inspired by the free-wheeling style of \n, a 1940's Harlem nightclub where Jazz players dueled each other with no regard for the rules of the times, \n literally swings its way from mood to mood and adventure to adventure. It is a wild ride where jokes fly as well as lead, pretty faces can be hidden behind an ugly mug, and help and harm can come where you least expect it.", "Cowboy Bebop is an animated film noir, first and last. It is the dark, rim, cynical, blackly humorous, morally ambiguous tale of four people struggling against uncaring meaningless random fate, in a situation they did not create; it's also the story of one man who is doomed to die because of his past. It's easy to imagine these characters dropped into \"The Maltese Falcon\" except for wardrobe--and the more I think about it, the more perfectly they fit. Even the overall look of the series has lots of darkness, lots of contrast, like those old films did.\nLikewise, Cowboy Bebop is also one long love letter to John Woo. The harsh lighting, the frantic pace of the martial arts sequences and gun battles, the action scenes that would have been insanely dangerous to do with flesh-and-blood stuntmen, the body count, the pacing, the timing. For example, the gun battle in the cathedral from Episode 5, \"Ballad of Fallen Angels,\" is obviously borrowed respectfully from John Woo's 1989 film \"The Killer.\" And then there's the repeated bird imagery.\nLastly, I think I see more than a little of \"\n\" in Cowboy Bebop, in the cynical humor and, especially, the character design. Femme fatale \n is femme fatale Mine Fujiko (albeit with purple hair and wardrobe apparently borrowed from the \n) to wisecracking daredevil \n's wisecracking daredevil \n. \n bears more than a passing resemblance to \n as well, though he's older, beefier, and not as snappy a dresser (note how strong the resemblance is, though, when Jet Black puts on the fedora in Episode 23, \"Brain Scratch\"). I could attempt to stretch a point by claiming that \n was based on Goemon, but there's not really much those two characters have in common other than an idiosyncratic fondness for edged weapons.\nThere are other influences too--spaghetti westerns (though maybe it's more a case of film noir influencing both spaghetti westerns and this series), Bruce Lee movies, blaxploitation. Episode 11, \"Toys in the Attic,\" is clearly a gentle parody of Ridley Scott's \"Alien.\" And so on.", "Cowboy Bebop takes us to the time of 2071, where space travel is commonplace and getting to Mars is just as easy as your common road trip. Gate technology has made the colonization of other worlds possible, enabling mankind to spread out and settle on the other planets and moons of our Solar System.

They all focus on one main character, a college boy named Akira Amemiya. Still, they have nothing to do with any of the stories found in \n.\nThe first things you'll notice here, after the sexy opening sex scene which takes place in a shower, is that the animators apparently only like to anime sex scenes. Meaning all non-sex scenes are simply still images. Sure, there's a bit of zooming or panning on these still frames, but they're still... uh... still. Maybe they thought the non-sex stuff wasn't important enough to receive the royal treatment of being animated, and it's true that the story still gets conveyed, but it just felt that stale... boring.\nAkira Amemiya is some super-hot guy that all the girls drool over. But sorry girls, he's taken! Right, as if that matters. Even his girlfriend, Yoshiko, pretty much knows that he's not a one-woman kind of guy... or one-man kind of guy either. Yep, that's right, he goes both ways! There's only one thing about him that kind of bugs Yoshiko is that he won't let her, or apparently anyone else for that matter, call him by his first name. Whenever she does, he gets upset and tells her that name belongs to someone else. The someone else? Well it's his super model sister of course!\n\nOkay, but getting back to the story... Yoshiko has a friend named Kaname. She's a hot little number who has a boyfriend named Tatsuro. The two are deeply in love, or so Kaname thinks, until one night when she spies him kissing another girl... another girl that has the exact same pair of earrings that he just recently gave Kaname. Saddened, she tosses her earrings on the ground and walks away... and runs into Amemiya. Although she has been disgusted by his infidelity up to this point, when she speaks to him she says simply and kindly \"Please, screw me\". Why? Because \"I want to be defiled by the most disgusting guy I know\".\n\nThe second chapter delves a little bit deeper into the Akira's relationship with his sister. Although she is still out of the country doing her whole modeling thing, we get to see their history through flashbacks, from the time they were kids until they were both not much younger than they are now. Apparently, Akira's sister has always liked to dress him up in girls clothing, like some sort of doll. And then one day she catches him feeling up and smelling her school uniform that was up on a hanger. This, however, did not disgust her....\n\nEach of the three chapters are about 25-30 minutes long. And, unfortunately, all of them suffer from the same lack of animation except in the sex scenes. And that's kind of a big deal seeing as how there's only about two sex scenes per chapter. So that's a whole lot of unanimated anime! And not only that, but there isn't a whole lot of story here. Akira is in love with his sister, but he can't have her and so has sex with basically whoever asks him to. And that's about the entire thing right there. It's really too bad, 'cause \n was really enjoyable to watch." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1995" ], "creator" : [ "Hiroyuki Utatane" ], "company" : [ "Pink Pineapple" ], "title" : [ "Count Down Akira" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Akira Amemiya" }, { "name" : "Tatsuro" }, { "name" : "Kaname" }, { "name" : "Yoshiko" }, { "name" : "Leona" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

For the most part, each episode is unrelated to every other episode, and were created by various artists, writers, producers, and the like. This makes for a wide variety of storytelling, animation styles, and character designs.\nCompiled together, they create a relatively diverse collection of anime porn, although many do seem to focus on the bondage theme. But if you're into hardcore anime porn, or even just curious, this would be a good set to get. With it, you can discover artists and directors that you tend to favor, and then look for other hentai animation where those people were involved with the development.\nA newly re-mastered 10th anniversary version of Cool Devices is now being released in 2005 by \n, which contains an English language track for the first time ever. Of course, it still contains the original Japanese dialog as well, with English subtitles available for those of us who can't quite speak the language yet.\n\n\n\nA pretty young woman named Ai is enjoying a night out with her friends when they spy...them, the couple of oh-so-shamefully dressed people. As her friends snicker, Ai stares on, curious and intrigued, though she doesn't know why. But then they are gone just as quickly as they came, and Ai can't help but follow.\nWhere she ends up she never could have imagined, an underground club that introduces her to the world of sexual bondage... but not just as a spectator. The couple knows she followed them, and is more than happy to strap her up and show her what it's all about. How could she have possibly fathomed what her initial curiosity would eventually turn her into... the same type of woman that her friends were all snickering at.\n\n\n\nA young man lives with his younger sister in the huge house left to them after their parents passed away. He often hosts wild sex parties there at night, while rarely participating in them. Instead, he chooses to look on through the massive number of hidden cameras he installed all throughout the mansion.\nStill, the woman he longs for is not any of the beautiful women he invites to the party... but instead is his little sister. And in a twist... she wants him to! The problem is he is conflicted about the whole incest thing, and so he does not act on his desires, nor does he entertain hers. But when another woman enters the picture, and figures out what's going on, she takes it upon herself to stir things up.\n\n\n\nOperation 3 is actually three shorts. The first is \n, where we find a woman on her knees in a locked pet cage wearing little more than rabbit ears, handcuffs, and a slender metal rod attached to her nipple piercings. Then another woman enters the room, this one wearing a skin title suit with cat-ears. She starts having fun with the caged bunny-girl until a man enters, bends the cat girl over the cage, and takes her while bunny-girl watches. More fun ensues with the man and the bunny girl, and we're shown some flashback scenes, though I'm not exactly sure what they were about. Perhaps training of some sort? Anyway, that's about all there is too this one. There is no talking, nor any story here, just pure porn.\n\nThe next short is called \n. We are introduced to a young couple at an indoor pool, where the girl is pleasing the guy while snow falls outside the windows. The guy then uses a box cutter to slice a hole in her swimsuit, strategically placed so they can continue their fun. Like the previous short, there really is no story here, just porn.\nThe final short is titled \n, and takes place in a bathroom stall. The boyfriend tells the young woman to disrobe, and although she seems reluctant, she eventually follows his instructions. And this is the theme through the whole short. She is always reluctant to do whatever her boyfriend tells her to do, yet she always ends up doing it anyway, and then at the end, after it's all over, all she can say is \"More, please\".\n\n\n\nTwo proportionally impossible young lasses, Kirei and Rui, are vacationing on a beautiful tropical island when they begin to realize there is nobody else around. It seems the lovely, bikini clad ladies have wandered onto an apparently deserted part of the island... notice I said \"apparently\". Unbeknownst to the busty babes, a psychotic gang of guys occupies this section of beach, and they're itching to have some fun. After literally Kirei literally runs into one of these locals, the two girls end up at his place for a drink... which knocks them out cold.\nWhen Kirei comes to, she finds Rui on top of her spreading some kind of paste all over her body, and apparently ready to have some fun, which is definitely out of character for her. All the while, the local guys are sitting right there in the room, naked, and enjoying the show. Later on, Kirei makes an escape attempt with Rui, but it doesn't go so well, and Rui doesn't see interested at all in getting away. It's too bad, because the guys decide they don't need her anymore, and toss her down some kind of shaft. Then they start to deliver Kirei her punishment.\n\n\n\nWe find that a young woman named Marino Ohkura has gone and gotten herself into the weird situation of becoming a sex slave. Now why'd you have to go and do that? It's not really explained exactly how this comes about, just that she was targeted by the sexy and masochistic beauty, Saki, for her master, Takayuki, and ends up at their mansion where she is quickly and completely unexpectedly put into training, against her will of course. We also learn that Takayuki is the son and prodigy of the now deceased Hiroyuki Sawawatari, a very famous S&M bondage painter, and a masochist female dominator who apparently did a good job of passing on the legacy, because Takayuki sure is good at what he does. The entire episode focuses solely on Saki and Takayuki's training of the lovely Marino.\n\n\n\nThis episode is a continuation of the previous, and introduces two additional slaves in training, Momomi and Haruka. Momomi takes to it like a fish to water, enjoying every sexual moment, but Haruka is a much more resistant type. She fights it all the way to the end. Also in the episode, we get to see more into S&M Queen Saki's past, like how as a little kid she got pleasure from tearing the limbs of her dolls. Then a little later in her past we are witness to her very own training as a slave, when she was a pet of the famous Hiroyuki Sawawatari. The three slaves-in-training get to make their public debut at an erotic costume ball hosted at the mansion, and all goes pretty well. Once it's time for the finale, it's not the three slaves that are the main attraction, but they are the ones who get to set it up....\n\n\n\nYellow Star is the name of a drug which supposedly makes one unable to move, while at the same time increasing sensations. And unfortunately for the buxom young Ayana, her new stepfather, Fujisawa, has a plentiful supply, which she learns about one night while her mom is out of town. It was the same night that she was going to go all the way with her boyfriend, Kohei. So instead of finding herself in the arms of the man she loves, she finds herself downstairs with her step-dad, unable to stop him, while her boyfriend anxiously waits outside for her to answer the door.\nThe next day her boyfriend is still hoping to get some, but Fujisawa keeps her on a tight leash. He has her way with her all week, and even brings in some buddies of his to have a good time as well. But there is only so much a young woman can take, and when Ayana eventually sees her chance to stop this evil step-dad, she takes it, and pulls his gun from his holster as he holds her close. Of course, this crooked detective isn't scared so easily, and Ayana has never shot a gun in her life. Then what happens next, neither one of them could have expected.\n\n\n\nOne day, as sweet schoolgirl Maya is walking along, minding her own business, some creepy-looking fortune teller calls out to her. Although she has no money, that's just fine, as all he wants Maya to do is look into the crystal ball, for when she does, she is transported to another world. When she comes to, she meets these two short humanoid lizard creatures, Heckle and Jackle, that offer to show her the way back to her world, but only if she takes her clothes off. Once naked, they tie her up and sell her into slavery.\nShe is bought by Lord Estilgar, some cool robot-looking dude, who sticks her in some device that keeps her arms and legs locked in place, spread out so she's completely exposed, and with some metallic tentacle thingy stuck up her you-know-where. When Heckle and Jackle come to pick up the other have of their fee, they stop by Maya's room to say hi... and she tricks them into releasing her. Now they have no choice but to escape, but when they become surrounded by guards, things don't look so hot. It's a good thing that Maya has a secret, one that even she doesn't know about.\n\n\n\nMaya's escape may have succeeded, but it didn't last. Once she is recaptured, she is put under the authority of Mistress Eluma to intensify her slave training. Through certain techniques having to do with that metal tentacle thing that gets reinserted, Maya comes to develop a piece of anatomy that any man would be proud to have. Leyna, another slave who has tried to help Maya through the ordeal, plans an escape with Maya, but this time they don't even make it outside. This is when Eluma decides that it would be best to turn Maya into a true slave of desires by implanting her with some kind of parasitic creature which destroys the mind and controls all desires.\nAll the meanwhile, Lady Miran and Lord Zeon have been ordered to fly to this world and investigate two things, if the planet was still neutral as is should be, and if the rumors of the ancient legend are truly coming to pass. Isn't there always a legend? And of course, Maya is at the center of it. It's too bad we don't get to find out what happens, since this second ends before Maya's final destiny is revealed, and there is no third part to the series. Oh well, I'm guessing that Maya would have fulfilled her destiny and brought peace across the galaxy, all while having a bunch of sex along the way.\n\n\n\nMasaki Hoshino awakes from an startling, yet erotic dream about some beautiful young maiden asking him to rescue her. He soon remembers where he is, on a train, then quickly realizes that some young girl is attempting to exit the train, with his backpack! His attempt to chase her down is thwarted by a passing train, but he soon finds his backpack and all it's contents dumped and scattered across a dirt road. Well, all it's contents minus his wallet, which had his money and train tickets. And if that wasn't enough bad luck, poor Masaki's soon witness to an earthquake. As he waits at the seemingly abandoned station for the next train, whom should cross his path but none other than Miyuki, the girl from his dream. She lets him know that the train won't be coming, for the quake blocked the roads and tracks. On the bright side, she then offers him a place to stay.\nShe lives in a mansion up on a cliff, overlooking the sea, along with her mother, Reiko, her sisters Mayu, Ryoko, and Mina, and their maid, Kana. And wouldn't you know it, but every single one of them is a smokin' hot babe. Maybe this wasn't such an unlucky day after all. During Masaki's bath, Kana enters and offers to wash his back, though she ends up doing a lot more than that. Then he passes out. He awakes to the sounds of moaning, and investigates... only to find Kana being punished by Mistress Ryoko. And again, he loses consciousness. The next morning, nobody seems to have any idea what he's talking about. Was it all just a dream?\n\n\n\nRina Yuki is a pop singer, known as the Virgin Idol for her squeaky clean image. One night after a show, she learns that her father has collapsed. At the hospital, she is approached by a man, Kurosaki. Apparently her father's company hasn't been doing so well, and currently owes a lot of money. Kurosaki sees this as a chance to get what he wants: Rina. If Rina signs with his company, Angel Productions, then Kurosaki agrees to wipe the debt clean. Rina doesn't like it, but she'd do anything to help her father, so she signs away. And of course there's a catch. There's always a catch.\nKurosaki says he wants to change Rina's image, tailor it to a more adult audience. So he assigns Takuya Kenzaki to be her new manager. He has Rina wear extremely skimpy and revealing outfits. He has her participate in erotic photo shoots. But in all the photos, she still doesn't look natural, like she wants it.

Originally the two episodes were released separately as Count Down and Count Down Continued.\nThe first part of the first episode is called \"Alimony Hunter\". One night, as Chizuru makes it to the quiet bus terminal, she spies two people seriously making out towards the back. Intrigued, she continues to watch, and realizes that it's not just two people, but two women. One of them the catches a glimpse of her staring, she quickly heads outside.\nOnce on the bus, she can't stop thinking about what she saw. As the thoughts flood her mind, her hand works its way down to her short skirt. She is startled when a young lady talks to her about taking the adjacent seat. Chizuru is naturally thoroughly embarrassed, especially after the lady sits down and comments that she saw her. But upon removing her hat and introducing herself as Jun Nakatani, Chizuru realizes it was actually one of the women she was watching in the terminal!\n\nSo the two get to talking, and by the time the bus gets to its express route and turns out the lights, the two women find themselves enjoying each others embrace, which is a total surprise to Chizuru. Chizuru, however, finds herself even more surprised once she unzips Jun's pants! It seems the lovely Jun is more than meets the eye! Afterwards, Chizuru invites Jun to stay at her fiancé's place with her and her stepson, Kunihiko.\n\nWhen they reach the house, Chizuru checks on Kunihiko, who's sick in bed with a fever, and introduces him to Jun Nakatani. Now tell me, what adolescent boy wouldn't be mentally undressing to gorgeous women standing in his bedroom?! Both girls realize it, and it turns them both on, so they start going at it just as soon as they retire to Chizuru's bedroom... which happens to be directly above Kunihiko's bedroom, so he gets to hear all the fun going on!\n\nCould any teenage boy resist the lure of those sounds? Well, if so, Kunihiko isn't among them! He seeks off to peek through their door, though he doesn't get to enjoy the view for long as Jun spots him watching... and invites him in to join the party!\n\nThe next part of the first episode is titled \"Seek\", and is about a brave knight who has set out to rescue a beautiful princess, though he's much more concerned with finding a challenging opponent rather than with the princess herself. He quickly dispatches the monstrous hoodlums who snatched the princess, and is rather disappointed that once again he has not found the challenge he was looking for. But on the plus side, the princess is a babe!\n\nThe way back to the castle is too long for a single days travel, so they stop at an inn, where brave sir knight bribes the innkeeper into claiming that there is only a single room left available. Once in the room, horny sir knight makes his move, and it seems to be going well until the princess's pleasure builds too much, unleashing her alternate personality! Gone is the shy, timid princess, now say hello to a bondage queen!\n\nThe third part is called \"Virgin Hunter\", and is about a young woman named Akemi who is about to marry her beloved fiancé, Kunihiko. Could this be the same Kunihiko from \"Alimony Hunter\"? Yep, pretty sure it is! Especially seeing as how a gorgeous hermaphrodite named Jun shows up to give Kunihiko and Akemi a proper send-off into their new life together. Yeah, Kunihiko is a bit older now, and Jun has cut her hair shorter, but it's no doubt these are the same people\n\nThe final part is called \"A Play On History - Hooligan Boy\". It involves a guy stealing away young girls and a guy that turns into a giant robot... but seriously, by this point to I really need to say anymore? All-in-all, this DVD has a good variety that keeps things entertaining, and is a real relief from a lot of those hentai episodes that are just one women domination scene after another. Unfortunately, the extra features on the disc are hardly worth mentioning. Just an image gallery, a few short outtakes, some staff comments, and some trailers. This is pretty typical for hentai releases, but I'd really like to start seeing something more, especially since we all know they have enough space on the disc." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1995" ], "creator" : [ "Hiroyuki Utatane" ], "company" : [ "Pink Pineapple" ], "title" : [ "Count Down" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Akemi" }, { "name" : "Kunihiko" }, { "name" : "Chizuru" }, { "name" : "Mai" }, { "name" : "Jun Nakatani" }, { "name" : "Princess" }, { "name" : "Kaede" }, { "name" : "Yoshimi" }, { "name" : "Knight" }, { "name" : "Yuki" }, { "name" : "Kuma" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

When \n sent \n, \n, and \n into Lyoko, they found \n and \n.\n is trying to destroy the world. There are 40 towers in Lyoko and when \n activates one the gang has to find it while battling monsters and trying to keep \n safe. When they find the tower \n must deactivate it, as she is the only one who can.\n is trying to materialize \n (bring her to Earth) so they can shut Lyoko down. If \n is in Lyoko when they try to shut it down she will die.\n also finds out that he can't shut Lyoko down without killing \n because \n put a virus on her. They later find out that \n was in the real world all along and that was why he let \n leave Lyoko. For a major twist they find out that there is a fifth sector in Lyoko. That's where \n lived. It also contained 5 new monsters.", "It all began when \n wanted to search the abandoned factory for parts for a robot he was building at the time. His search led him to the supercomputer (which was then in a powered-down state). Curious, he turns it on, then goes to the terminal, where he discovers a virtual world... and what he thinks is an artificial intelligence.\nThe next day...\n enters the academy and makes his acquaintance with his roommate: \n. It's not a very rosy, to say the least.\nMeanwhile, \n begins to make his acquaintance with his supposed AI (which he's tentatively named \n). She had \"come to\" inside one of the Neutral Towers. Under \n's guidance, they soon learn that she's not alone. In fact, she's under threat!\n returns to class. While \n and \n talk, \n tries to buy a drink... and gets shocked! Though they know each other as classmates, this is the first time the three of them interact outside class. It's also the prelude to \n's first attack--though the drink machine.\nNow, \n makes \n's acquaintance during a martial class held by \n that evening. Turns out they're the only two students in the class! And it turns out neither of them are slouches, though \n wins by surprising \n with her skill.\nLater, \n learns \n's little secret: his dog, Kiwi! Meanwhile, \n's computer comes under attack. He soon makes the connection between events now and earlier and the supercomputer. \n happens to be outside his room when the attack occurs. He hears the commotion and rushes in to help. Afterward, he insists on learning what's going on. That's when \n leads \n to the factory and tells him about Lyoko.\nWith \n accompanying him, \n lays out what he knows about the system and describes the means by which someone can be Virtualized and sent into Lyoko. In need of a test subject, \n tries to snatch Kiwi. However, \n catches on and follows. \n, attempting to woo \n, sees them and also follows. At the factory, \n sneaks in and happens to end up caught in the scanner capsule as \n activates the virtualization program. \n is forced to go in after him. In their initial adventures, they discover the gist of battling in Lyoko (the Way Towers, the creatures, and so on). After being devirtualized by attacks and fending off an assault within the factory, this is where part one ends.", "The next day... Also note at this point, \n is still in on the secret.\n has regained contact with \"\n\" and is trying to figure out a way to transport her to Earth.\n and \n meet again for a rematch in the gym.\nAnd \"\n\" senses the activated tower and realizes trouble is afoot.\nBack in the gym, \n and \n make each other's formal acquaintance after an exhausting match.\nThen, \n gets attacked from her closet! Minutes later, \n and \n are attacked in the gym.\nThen \n gets a call from \n, concerning the attacks. Because \n is with him and is quick to figure things out, she insists on coming along. \n has no choice but to lead her to the factory. Everyone soon links up at the factory, and \n gets her first taste of Lyoko. Together, they link up with \n and help her reach the activated tower.\nIt's in the tower that \"\n\" learns her real name, \n, when she uses the name as part of the \"Code: Lyoko\" sequence to deactivate the tower and stop the attacks. Just in time, because not only is \n being attacked inside the factory, but \n spilled the beans about the factory, and the authorities are closing in. But with the tower deactivated, \n is able to launch a program he found: Return to the Past. And with it, events and memories of the initial attack are reversed. However, \n, \n, and \n retain their memories. \n's memories, on the other hand, are limited to the events of the first night. The others soon fill in the gap, and they soon make the connection: people who have been virtualized don't lose their memory from a Return to the Past. \n realizes he can correct his problem by simply virtualizing himself once, and he'll be in the same boat again.\nAfter some probing, \n and \n soon figure what happened: the \n program. It's here that the setup for first season is completed. \n hopes to materialize \n, but with \n capable of striking at any time, it's dangerous. \n wants the supercomputer shut down, but the others disagree.

Y'see, in Crest the two met and nearly died a bunch of times while escaping the Abh Empire's enemies. Oh yeah, and they managed to fall in love along the way too.\nSo, can love flourish between a gal who's bluer than the ocean and a guy whose home world is in the hands of the enemies? While set against the backdrop of a galactic conflict? Watch and see.\nBased on the books by Hiroyuki Morioka, Banner's got GREAT writing and clean, crisp art. The only slight knocks I have about the series are that because it's character driven and not action (i.e., space battle) driven, it drags a bit at times. The only other problem is that I don't think you could view this series more than once, so that brings down the score a bit. Solid Gold stuff though otherwise.\nAnd now for some background. As long as man existed, he's always wanted someone else to do the dirty work for him. And in this series, that \"Someone else\" was the Abh. So, as humankind expanded into space, the Abh were engineered to serve in hazardous duties in space without getting hazardous duty pay. Think of them as disposable people.\nNeedless to say, the Abh didn't like that much. So they rebelled and built a world-spanning empire to ensure their own survival with a fleet of warships that would make any villain with megalomaniacal dreams drool.\nAnywhoo, this empire's gotten so big that the remainder of natural-born humanity's (the Abhs don't reproduce the normal way, bleh) pretty darn nervous about paying homage to an empress the color of a Crayola crayon, so they decide to deal with the Abh... permanently. The Abh were only too happy too oblige, so now both sides are locked in a battle that will decide the fate of mankind for once and all after a three-year truce.\nYou'd think that with such grand themes going on, the characters would have a huge role to play in the coming rumble. Especially since \n's supposed to inherit the Abh throne. Instead, she and \n are stuck on one of the smallest, more vulnerable ships in the Abh fleet and are in the vanguard of the attack. Not really a recipe for a long, prosperous life.\nOkay, anyone just get the Star Trek reference?\nSo, between life-and-death battles, \n and \n keep their romance alive while trying (and failing) to hide it from their crewmates. Oh yeah, never mind that the Ekuryua, another pretty Abh girl has her eyes on \n too. *Chuckles and rubs his hands together*" ], "jp_info" : { "genre" : [ "Sci-Fi" ], "released" : [ "13 OVA episodes" ], "title" : [ "Seikai No Senki", "Banner of the Stars" ] } }

C'mon guys, lets try to get some imagination injected into these titles! Let's hire on some new blood to write something that doesn't involve students or nurses. Please?!\n\nWell, even if the story is as far from unique as you could get in a Vanilla Series title, at least the artwork and art direction are above average. This is definitely one of the nicer looking hentai titles I've seen in a while. There are many scenes that are very well detailed, especially when it comes to the characters. This made it very easy for me to pick out great-looking screenshots. Also, there were a lot of non-standard camera angles used here, which helped to keep the film interesting despite the story.\n\nThe story. Okay, so it starts out with Professor Kyoichi Shizuma giving his first lesson on how to be a sex slave to the green-haired class president, Yumiko Nitou. The beautiful and busty Professor Kusugi stands close by, watching, and it soon becomes clear that although this is Yumiko's first time with Professor Shizuma, it is far from her first lesson as a sex slave. And what's more is that she really enjoys the lessons! And what's even more beyond that is the little tidbit of knowledge that she has, as of yet, never achieved an orgasm. Poor girl!\n\nThe next day Professor Shizuma is given the profiles of two new girls that need to start training, the problematic Tomo Nagasato, and Asuna Narita, for whom the academy has high hopes. First up is Tomo, who finds herself being violated in her own bedroom after awaking from whatever drugs Professor Shizuma slipped her. Her repeated pleas to stop fall on deaf ears. Before Asuna gets her turn, Professor Shizuma has another session with Yumiko in which he succeeds in giving her that which she has been lacking for so long. Next up is Asuna, whom is lured to an otherwise empty classroom by Professor Shizuma where he quickly ties her up and begins the lesson.\n\nAlrighty, so Professor Shizuma not only got both of his two new assignments trained, but also managed to provide Yumiko with her first orgasms. Things are looking good for the perverted professor... uh-oh, maybe I spoke too soon. It looks like Tomo and Asuna are gonna try to break out during the night and alert the authorities to what's been going on. I guess the professor's lessons weren't as effective as he thought! Of course, that's not gonna stop him from trying again, and this time with the help of a couple colleges and the aid of a video camcorder.

This statement sets the scene for the entire Robotech saga. In 1999, during a global civil war, a spaceship exited a space fold and crash landed on Earth. This crash put things into perspective for everyone on Earth. The entire civil war was called off as humanity explored, investigated, and rebuilt \"The Visitor\" as the ship was called early on. \"The Visitor\" was rebuilt and renamed the Super Dimensional Fortress 1, or the SDF-1. The SDF-1 was to be mankind's first line of defense against any alien invasion. The leaders of Earth felt, rightly so, that whoever built the ship would come looking for it and they might not be peaceful.\nTen years later the SDF-1 has been rebuilt and as it prepares to launch, a number of alien ships exit out of a space fold. These ships belong to the Zentraedi, an alien race bent on retaking the SDF1. Through an automated defense onboard the SDF1, mankind fires the first shot and destroys part of the attacking Zentraedi fleet. Battle quickly ensues and soon mankind is fighting a desperate war that they have little chance of winning...", "The first Robotech war had ended fifteen years ago with the defeat of the Zentraedi, but a new threat is about to emerge.\nTen years have passed since the SDF-3 launched to Tirol and with it went the heros of the war. No one on Earth realized that the expeditionary mission was a failure, the Robotech Masters had long since left Tirol and are heading towards Earth. It is a slow journey without the necessary Protoculture required to make the space fold.\nEarth has changed since the time before the war. Humans are tougher, stronger and willing to fight for what they believe in. Fifteen years after the 1st Robotech war, the first graduates out of the United Earth Forces Military Academy are pressed into service. It is on their graduation day when the Robotech Masters arrive.\nThe Robotech Masters quickly lay siege to Earth. The United Earth Force responds by opening fire on the Robotech Masters and the 2nd Robotech war begins. Once again humanity is thrown into a conflict in which they have little hope of winning...", "Only a few short years have passed since the defeat of the Robotech Masters, but Earth is a different place. The Regiss has invaded the planet and has begun to harvest the Flowers of Life. Earth has been nearly beaten into submission with only a few bands of freedom fighters attempting to overthrow the Invid. Through several miscalculations, the REF arrives at Earth several years too late to stop the Invid. The first wave sent to dislodge the Invid meets with complete disaster as resistance is much fiercer than originally expected.\nOne of the only survivor is Lt. Scott Bernard, who ends up creating his own band of resistance fighters. He has resigned himself to carrying out \n's last orders to his group, to find the Invid hive (code named Reflex Point) and destroy the Invid Regiss. Meanwhile, \n prepares for the second and third waves to lauch to Earth, for with them are the newly created Shadow Fighters and Neutron S-Bombs which will defoliate Earth of the Flower of Life and render it uninhabitable.\nThis is the third and final saga of the Robotech television series, however there was a movie that was made afterward, which was comprised of two seperate anime series, Megazone 23 and Southern Cross, and about 10 minutes of newly created animation." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1982–83", "; 1984", "; 1983-84" ], "creator" : [ "Shoji Kawamori" ], "company" : [ "Artland", "Studio Nue", "Tatsunoko", "Big West", "ARTMIC" ], "title" : [ "Choujiku Yousai Macross", "Super Diminsional Fortress Macross", "Choujiku Kidan Southern Cross", "Super-Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross", "Kikou Souseiki Mospeada", "Genesis Climber Mospeada" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/episodes.htm", "name" : "-- View Episode List --" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/index-shadow_chonicles.htm", "name" : "Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_plus/index.htm", "name" : "Macross Plus" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_2/index.htm", "name" : "Choujiku Yousai Macross II: Lovers Again" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_7/index.htm", "name" : "Macross 7" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_zero/index.htm", "name" : "Macross Zero" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_do_you_remember_love/index.htm", "name" : "Gekijouban Choujiku Yousai Macross: Ai, Oboete Imasu Ka" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_flash_back_2012/index.htm", "name" : "Super Dimensional Fortress Macross Flash Back 2012" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/macross_frontier/index.htm", "name" : "Macross F" } ], "director" : [ "Noburo Ishiguro", ", Yasuo Hasegawa", ", Katsuhisa Yamada" ], "released" : [ "36 TV episodes, 1 movie", "; 23 TV episodes", "; 25 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Roli Dosel" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/admhayes.htm", "name" : "Takashi Hayase" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/azonia.htm", "name" : "Lap Lamiz" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/bowie.htm", "name" : "Bowie Emerson" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/ben.htm", "name" : "Hayao Kakizaki" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/dana.htm", "name" : "Jeanne Francaix" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/breetai.htm", "name" : "Britai Kridanik" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/nova.htm", "name" : "Lana Isavia" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/claudia.htm", "name" : "Claudia La Salle" }, { "name" : "Claude Leon" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/dana.htm", "name" : "Komillia Jenius" }, { "name" : "Andrzej Slawski" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/fokker.htm", "name" : "Roy Focker" }, { "name" : "Louis Ducasse" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/robotech/gloval.htm", "name" : "Bruno J.

Alexis is Rad's other friend, about the same age. She refuses to go along with them. When they leave for the mountain, two boys named Billy and Fred follow them. They're basically bullies from the school. At the entrance of the cave, Carlos ties a string of rope to a rock to help them find the way back out. Billy and Fred follow, but they lose track of them and get lost. Rad and Carlos come across an old, undiscovered part of the mountain that nobody knew about. It looked like a space ship crashed into the mountain some years back. Rad finds a little hexagon shaped object in the ground glowing a green color.\nWhen he touches it, an earthquake starts, and three lights shoot from the thing. Alexis finds out that the epicenter of the quake is at the mountain where Rad and Carlos are, and hurries over to make sure they're alright. The boys find a way out, Rad still holding the strange object, and so do Fred and Billy, but they don't end up in the same place. When they leave the cave, the strange object glows again, and transforms into a small robot. Then a really huge robot, \n, leader of the evil Decepticons, appears and attempts to capture the little robot.\nThe little robot's head starts spinning, and it takes on the same characteristics as a bike, transforming into one, telling Rad and the others to get on (though Rad is the only one who can understand it). \n chases them, and throws a rock with an extremely high force at them, causing them to fall. When the \n reaches for Rad and the little robot, another really huge robot appears telling him to stop. It's \n, leader of the Autobots, who are the good guys. As they begin to battle, another robot shows up. This one is \n, another Decepticon. Right after him comes Red Alert, an Autobot. Right after Red Alert, comes Demolisher, a Decepticon. And after Demolisher comes \n, an Autobot.\nAs soon as they start to fight, \n tells them to retreat. After they leave, the Autobots look for the kids who have the mini-con. It's later explained, after all the formalities, that the mini-cons are what the two races are fighting about. When linked with an Autobot or a Decepticon, their power increases greatly, and that the Decepticons want to use them to control everything. They also explain that the mini-cons were sent to Earth to hide them from the Decepticons, but when the mini-con signature was detected, the two groups came to Earth, scanning vehicular forms so that they could fight without the general populace knowing about it.\nSo Rad and his friends, joined by Billy and Fred, decided to help the Autobots find the Minicons, which are scattered all over the world, before the Deceptions do.\nAs time passed, more Autobots (\n, Scavenger, Blur, Jetfire, and Sideswipe) and Decepticons (\n, Wheeljack, and TidalWave) appear to join the fight. Even a mysterious Transformer named \n joins the fray, but his agenda was unknown. By the time the three most powerful Minicon Triads were awakened and the battles moved to Cybertron, it was revealed that the Minicons' Creator/Arch-Enemy was \n. \n takes advantage of the Cybertron War with his acolyte Sideways and the newly recruited \n helping him. This made the Autobot and Deceptions have no choice but to join forces to fight the titanic \n.\nWhen transformed, \n is a tractor truck, \n is a sports car, and Red Alert is an emergency vehicle. For the Decepticons, \n is a tank, Demolisher is a anti-aircraft vehicle, \n is a jet-fighter, and \n an Apache helicopter." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Jan 10, 2002" ], "title" : [ "Super Living-Robot Transformers: The Legend of Micron", "Transformers: Micron Legends", "Cho Robot Seimei Tai Transformer Micron Densetsu" ], "company" : [ "TV Tokyo", "Aeon", "Dangun", "Hangzhou", "M.S.J.

Hard to believe that five out of six of them are not even out of school yet!\nHowever large the responsibility or the task may seem, these six fighters are ready to roar!!! Of course they are helped out by the maids who do the calculations and the repairs of the Gravion. And let's not forget the boss, Klein Sandman, and his right-hand man, Raven. The boss, or \"Sandman\" for short, is very serious most of the time and isn't very talkative. And his assistant is quite mysterious, but he seems nicer than Sandman. Even though this is one of the shortest anime I've heard of, it's still really good!!!" ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct 7, 2002–Dec 16, 2002", "Jan 8, 2004–Mar 25, 2004" ], "creator" : [ "Masami Obari, Kazumitsu Akamatsu" ], "company" : [ "GONZO", "Media Factory" ], "title" : [ "Chojushin Gravion Zwei", "Super Heavy God Gravion", "Choujuushin Gravion Zwei" ], "director" : [ "Masami Obari" ], "released" : [ "25 TV Episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Eiji Shigure" }, { "name" : "Luna Gusuku" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Mizuki Tachibana" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Leele" }, { "name" : "Toga Tekuji" } ], "genre" : [ "Mecha", "Action", "Comedy", "Ecchi" ] } }

Yes, they are all vampires, migrated from Transylvania to Japan, who suck blood and stuff. However, it seems \n is the oddball in the family! For unlike her family, who sucks blood, she does the exact OPPOSITE of taking blood. Yup, you guessed it. If she bites somebody, she GIVES blood to them. She also can go out during the day and is not weakened by crosses, holy water, garlic, exc. Not only that, but when she is around happy people or under certain stress (the manga says once a month) give gets a nosebleed! This ain't a tiny nosebleed you get when you get hit in the nose with a soccer ball, this nosebleed is like a fire hose! And to save herself from embarrassment and/or revealing the secret she and her whole family are vampires, she has to keep it all secret. Good luck with that.\nBut sadly, she has no luck with that. For a new exchange student, a young boy with a bad, glarey-eye problem named \n, arrives at \n's school. Unfortunately, his unhappy vibes gives \n a bad nosebleed. Then he spots \n biting 3 people--one of which is his own mother (although he finds out \n is a vampire only after the 3rd person). So now he knows \n's secret--which is bad for the both of them! You see, if Usui spills the beans, he'll lose ALL of his memories! Also, he must take care of \n in the light of day, since her family can't, and make sure to clean up in case if she gets any nosebleeds.\nLooks like it's a start of a beautiful, comical romance!

You've got a Japanese animated series you want to dub into English, but because of different episode run requirements in the two countries, you find yourself several episodes short of a full U.S. syndicated season. Solution? Grab another series, do a little slice and dice, and try to fix everything when you do the dubbing. The younger tykes probably won't know the difference, but if you listen closely, you can hear the sounds of die-hard anime buffs screaming (or possibly swearing in Japanese) in households across the country.\nIn Japan, artist Leiji (Reiji) Matsumoto had a string of anime hits, including the saga of Space Pirate Captain Harlock. Set in the year 2976, the show focused on the title character, a typical sea dog who was forced to conduct his business in outer space after the oceans had all been destroyed.\nUnfortunately, Harlock only conducted his business for 43 episodes, so Harmony Gold (importers of \n) added elements from another Matsumoto series, \n. Never mind the fact that the latter show was set in 1999 and had nothing to do with space pirates, it was available, and you never know what you can create in the editing room. Coming to American audiences in 1985, the two series were edited and redubbed into one 65-episode story, retitled Captain Harlock and the Queen of 1000 Years.\nHere's the story, as reconstituted for U.S. audiences: Unlike the famed pirates of the past, \n actually had a noble purpose to his ship-jacking and cargo-destroying raids. The Earth of the future was a decadent, vice-heavy world (think Ancient Rome with 30th Century technology). Taking to the skies, the Captain set out to destroy loads of drugs, alcohol and other useless pleasure goods. Like any good pirate, though, \n cut a dashing rebel figure with his shaggy mane, cape, eyepatch and scar.\nMost episodes focused on \n's conflicts with Queen Lafresia, the evil alien ruler of the Zetons (Mazones in the Japanese original and in the Harlock/Millennia dub- Zetons comes from the ZIV dub). These warrior plant-women came from a planet that could no longer support life, and so they set their sights on Earth. Professor Hairball (Daiba in the original, and Dr. Drake in the Harmony Gold dub) warned of their impending invasion, but he was laughed off as a crackpot theorist. When the Zetons did invade, they killed the Professor and framed \n for the crime.

Taking the car without permission, without even a drivers license, and then plowing it into the side of a building... good thing his father is a powerful man, president of both his own company and the school Masaki attends. But dad's had it with his son's reckless and irresponsible ways, and he tells Masaki that this is it, after this incidence he will no longer call Masaki his son. He cannot trust the future of his empire to such careless boy, and so he tells Masaki right there that he is disowned, and cut off. To help the boy out, he pulls out a bunch of invoices from his desk, invoices of old debts that he says he never excepts to see money from, and gives them to Masaki to do with what he will, hopefully to show that he can get things done.\n\nAt first, Masaki doesn't take the invoices seriously. It's not until Riko, their maid, points out to Riko that one of his school buddies' father is listed on an invoice. That peaks Masaki's attention, and gets him to finally actually go to class, even if it is only to collect a mountain of money. So what if it make his school pal's father go out of the business he worked so hard to build. Oh yeah, and the school pal in question just happens to be an attractive, busty young woman named Mizuki Kanna. Did I forget to mention that? Well Mizuki can hardly believe it herself, but after she's able to verify Masaki's claim, she becomes desperate to help save her father's business, not to mention her home. \"I'll do anything\", she says... and Masaki takes her up on that!\n\nThen on the walk home one evening, Masaki literally runs into an old friend, another attractive, busty young woman, this one named Mai Mutsuki. Mai is overjoyed to see her old pal, Masaki. Unfortunately, Mai's father also seems to owe a huge amount of money to their family, which makes what Masaki has to ask her all that much more... oh who am I kidding, it doesn't make it difficult at all. Masaki gets off on doing this kind of thing! At least time it's not quite blackmail, as least not like it was with Mizuki. You see, Mai has actually been in love from before, so it doesn't take much to start their \"relations\". But Mai doesn't know about Mizuki, and what Masaki is doing to her... well, at least not yet. Oops, did I say too much?\nAnd just when it looks like everything's going Masaki's way, just when it seems that he actually can make it on his own, just when it looks like he's found his mojo... BAM!

The end of the anime takes place during the first World War.\nAnnie and Candy were best friends who were raised in the same ophanage until around the age of 6. When Annie got adopted by a rich family, she started ignoring Candy. Annie wrote to Candy that she had alot of new friends and she doesn't want anyone to know that she is from an ophanage. It hurt Candy very much, but she never felt that Annie was no longer her friend. She always thought of Annie and hoped they would meet again.\nBefore Candy was adopted by a rich family, she was adopted to be a playmate for a rich family's daughter. Eliza and Carl were very mean and always made jokes about her, but she just ignored their rudeness. But Candy never gave up hope that someday she will get a family which treasures her.\n\nShe eventually got over the sadness and was happy again, even after her best friend Antony died in a horse race. She realize that people die but they will always live on in your heart.\nCandy had faith and trusted her friends. When Annie and Candy met again, Annie begged Candy not to take Gary away, because Gary was in love with Candy and Annie was in love with Gary. But Candy make her understand that Gary only likes her. She also helped her to realize that she should stand up for herself, because she was afraid that when her classmates found out that she is from an orphanage, they won't talk to her anymore. Finally, Annie admitted to her classmates that she is also from an orphanage. Candy and Annie were best friends again.\nCandy was a very caring person. She helped her other best friend, Lucy, when the school found out that Lucy was hiding a turtle in her room. Candy begged her teacher to let her take care of it. If not, the school would get rid of the small, cute turtle. Candy escaped from the school and put the turtle in the zoo. That shows how much Candy cared for her friends.\nWhen her lover, Terry, left her for the actress Suzanne, Candy didn't blame Terry or Suzanne. She was very understanding about why Terry did what he did. At last, when she could have been a rich lady just from her family, she didn't. She wanted to work to support herself. She wanted to be independent.\nCandy is a very caring, understanding, reasonable, hard-working, loving person, and she never gives up. She worked her way through. We should learn from her to always stick with your friends because maybe someday you may need their help!" ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct. 1976–Feb. 1979" ], "creator" : [ "Mizuki Kyoko, Igarashi Yumiko" ], "company" : [ "Toei Animation" ], "title" : [ "Candy Candy" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Anthony" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Irasya" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ] } }

I have, however, decided to include it on this site anyway. If you're one of those hard-core anime purists who can't stand seeing a non-anime series on a site dedicated to Japanese Animation, then just press the Back button on your web browser and pretend like you were never here.\nEon Kid, a CGI animated television show, is a joint production between Korea, Spain, and the United States. Sorry fellow anime fans, but Japan was not involved in this one, though some anime influence is noticeable. It takes place in a futuristic setting, where sentient robots are the norm and some evil guy wants to rule everything. Luckily, the show has a hero with the drive and spirit to take on any challenge... even if he is currently unaware of this fact. But hey, give him a break, he's only an 11 year old boy after all! He's got plenty of time to grow into it....\nUnfortunately, circumstances to force poor Marty to start embracing his destiny sooner than anyone would have liked. A young girl named Ally ran away from her father, Duke Von Rhymer (remember that evil guy I mentioned earlier...), and she winds up running into Marty. Marty and his dad give her a place to sleep for the night, but fearing that the goons her father sent to find her would put her new friends in danger, she decides to take off. Marty follows, they come under assult, and eventually wind up in an underground cavern where Marty's annoying robotic dog, Buttons, finds a cool-looking robotic arm. Well, turns out it's actually a glove, and it practically fuses itself to Marty's arm.\nAnd it's a good thing, too, as it provide Marty with the superhuman fighting power he needed to get them out of their sticky predicament. But on the down side, the thing won't come off! Could you imagine been forced to wear a giant metal glove all day and all night? I sure would make sleeping difficult, and what about showers? I bet that arm would get pretty ripe. But all that's nothing compared to the trials Marty, Ally, and Buttons are about to face, when Marty's father is captured and they trio are forced to go on the run by themselves, being chased by not one, but several teams of bad guys.\nBesides Duke Von Rhymer and his lackies, there's also some robot called Black Beauty chasing after them, a biker gang, a team of thieves (I think they are organic beings, but I'd be hesitant to call them human...), and since there is a bounty out on their heads, you can expect to find bounty hunters around every corner. Phew! Thankfully, our underage troupe also has the luck of meeting some fine, upstanding individuals who end up helping them out on their journey, such as George, a retired robot boxer who now hauls cargo on his semi truck.\nThe art did not strike me as anything fantastic. I know it's styleize and isn't supposed to look realistic, but it just feels as if I've seen better CGI in some videogames. The characters seem more like dolls to me, with stiff hair that doesn't move and non-fluid facial expressions. The story is intriguing, I just wish they could have done a better job on the art. Oh, and I also HATE Marty's robot dog, Buttons. He is sooooo annoying! Almost every time Buttons shows up on screen I wish Marty would just deactivate him, chop him up, and throw him in a scrap heap. Buttons is supposed to serve as the comic relief, but he isn't funny. Not in the slightest.\nThe show originally aired in the US on September 22, 2007, and the first five episodes are coming to DVD on August 12, 2008.

Luckily, the dean of the school is one of Dark Mother's minions, so she sends one of her hench-women, Mistress Nailkaizer, to meet with him and help search for students who could potentially be the elusive Angel Blade.\n\nAfter careful analysis, Nailkaizer determines that it must be Seiryu Tenmyoin, the Student Body president and most popular girl in school. Not only is Seiryu extremely good at athletics, she's also smart, sexy, and has the same body type as our scantily clad heroine. But before launching an all out attack on Seiryu, Nailkaizer first tries to get busty role model to reveal her hidden identity by going undercover as a professor. Of course, Nailkaizer doesn't succeed with her plan, simply due to the fact that Seiryu is not the woman they're looking for.\n\nAlso attempting to uncover the secret identity of this shapely warrior are two policewomen, one of whom is actually a legendary guardian. With abilities beyond that of normal humans, Ayame Fudo is also trying to stop the Dark Mother, which is why she is seeking out Angel Blade. But Ayame is then captured while attempting to rescue Seiryu, who was captured by Nailkaizer in order to force Seiryu into revealing her secret identity. Of course, when Ayame appears, Nailkaizer realizes she was wrong about Seiryu, and instead mistakenly thinks that Ayame is Angel Blade... that is until the real Angle Blade appears to fight off Nailkaizer and rescue both of the well-stacked damsels.\n\nSo, who is the real Angel Blade you ask? Enter Moena Shinguji, a younger girl who looks up to and aspires to be like her idol, Seiryu, although she feels she never can because she's so much smaller, and flatter. Little does Moena know that she herself is actually the voluptuous champion named Angel Blade. Somehow, the spirit of her dead mother enables the pint-size squirt to transform in the full-figured warrior of freedom, although Moena retains no memory of the events that transpire when she does.\nUnfortunately, that's about where the DVD leaves off, so I don't where the story eventually leads to. But let me tell you, for a hentai title, this is a story that's done very well, and much more complex than you'd usually see. Also, the art and animation here are excellent, even if some of the characters are exaggerated. This definitely has the feel of a high-budget title, something you don't see to often in hentai videos.", "The story has a few more twists in it after the first DVD. First off, Angel Blade has a couple partners. Angel Ender, and Angel Beretta, both of them equally without clothes for the most part. Angel Ender's real Identity is the women we saw briefly in the first DVD, her name is Shaiya Hishizaki, and from what I've seen she's a Swimsuit Model of some kind. Angel Beretta. I'm guessing, is a new character named Elfie Elfwood, who herself might be Nailkaiser in disguise (long story, I'll get to that in a moment). Angel Ender used mostly hand-to-hand fighting and has a full head covering helmet. She is the Prototype for the \"Angel System\". Angel Beretta, meanwhile, is self explanatory. She uses a pair of modified Beretta's in each hand and is a crack shot.\nMoving on, Moena's Aunt, Kyoka, is actually the 'mother' of the Angel Units. Her womb is used to form the heart pendants, armlets, and chokers. That's what she and Moena's father were doing in the lab at the end of the Second episode of the first DVD, working on another Angel Unit. Don't ask me how the process works exactly as I don't know yet.\n\nNext twist, Dark Mother/Mistress Phantom Lady, she is actually Moena's mother Maina, but she's either been possessed by a demon, or twisted by an early form of the Angel System, details are still sketchy, but those are the two most likely explanations.\nGoing back to Nailkaiser, after the third episode found in the DVD \"Angel Blade Returns\", it seems there is a special Episode that was never released here in America where Nail got her hands on AB and had some fun with her. During that event, Angel Blade awoke some lost memories in Nail which begin manifesting in the opening of the Angel Blade Punish Series. It seems Mistress Phantom made Nailkaiser the way she is after 'rescuing' her from some Geo-Bloods.\nBefore then, she was shorter, had smaller breasts, and a less curved figure.\n\nDuring the first Episode of Angel Blade Punish, Mistress Phantom betrays Nail and plans to sacrifice her to something called Chaos. Angel Blade and Angel Ender are trapped with her in a big blade void along with Kyoka. Angel Blade powers up and frees them, but loses in a one on one fight with Phantom. Her confidence is then shaken for the remainder of the Punish DVD until the end.\nWe see Ender, Blade, Kyoka, and Nail all escape from Mistress Phantoms castle with Ayame's help at the last minute. Where Nail went after their escape is unknown. Kyoka is in a coma of some kind from being raped by Karin earlier and is left in a hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Moena, Shaiya, and Ayame all travel to some beach resort together where Shaiya is doing a photo shoot. There, they meet the minions of Black Widow, another of Mistress Phantoms lackeys. Black Widow is a hot redhead with a bondage kind of get-up, and her two boys are a pair of Chip-n-dale dancer guys with big muscles. During her first fight with Black Widow, Moena's shaken confidence causes her powers to weaken, resulting in a new, less revealing Angel Blade. She is rescued at the last minute by Angel Beretta, but not even Ender knows who she is or where she came from.\n\nWe also meet Elfie Elfwood, a cowgirl type character who I think might be Nailkaiser in disguise, the reasons for the deception I still don't know. She and Moena become fast friends and have a little Yuri fun in the hot tub later on where Moena sees a vision of an angelic Nailkaiser with lighter skin. Elfie also seems to be Angel Beretta, but we never see her transform, but she has a heart gem on her shirt similar to Moena and Shaiya's gems. She also knows Moena is Angel Blade, but Moena doesn't remember when Elfie revealed she knew this because of what happened moments later in that hot tub.\nThe end of Punish shows Moena's friend Hasumi and her father (Hasumi stumbled across Isato in Angel Blade Returns moments after he was attacked by Karin and Kyoka was kidnapped) going to see Kyoka in the hospital. This hints at Hasumi also becoming an Angel at some point, but that's only my guess." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2001" ], "creator" : [ "Masami Obari" ], "company" : [ "Studio G-1 Neo" ], "title" : [ "Angel Blade", "Enjeru Bureido" ], "director" : [ "Masami Obari" ], "released" : [ "OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Angel Blade" }, { "name" : "Karin" }, { "name" : "Ayame Fudo" }, { "name" : "Kyoka" }, { "name" : "Chloe" }, { "name" : "Maina" }, { "name" : "Dean" }, { "name" : "Mistress Phantom" }, { "name" : "Elaine" }, { "name" : "Moena Shinguji" }, { "name" : "Emily" }, { "name" : "Nailkaizer" }, { "name" : "Hasumi" }, { "name" : "Seiryu Tenmyoin" }, { "name" : "Isato" }, { "name" : "Shaiya" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai", "Action" ] } }

There are many similarities between the two, but \n, being a 26 episode television series, is able to delve much deeper into the mystical fantasy world of El-Hazard. Of course, later on another television series was produced called El-Hazard: The Alternative World, and that was a sequel to the original OVA series rather than expanding on \n.\nThe story starts in an average Japanese high school where we soon meet our four main characters, Katsuhiko Jinnai, Makoto Mizuhara, Nanami Jinnai, and Mr. Fujisawa. My favorite is Nanami, because even though she's still a high school student, she is a no-nonsense independent business woman who's always on the lookout for ways to make a few bucks and get ahead in life. She is good friends with fellow student, Makoto, who is a reserved, kind-hearted 17-year old science geek that, unbeknownst to him, has a lifelong rivalry with Nanami's insane older brother and student body president, Katsuhiko Jinnai. Makoto often one-ups Katsuhiko without attempting to and without even realizing it, which unfortunately, this causes Katsuhiko to see Makoto as an adversary who is out to destroy him. And Makoto has no clue about this!\nThe rivalry, combined with Katsuhiko's unstable mental health, leads to the pair struggling over a machine Makoto built, which is what ends up inadvertently causing our four main characters to be thrown into a strange fantasy world called El-Hazard. They all land smack dab in the middle of a forest, separated from each other, though Makoto and Mr. Fujisawa quickly run into each other. They soon realize that Fujisawa actually has super strength on this world when he saves a pretty young lady by decimating these giant humanoid bug-like creatures. And of course that lady turns out to be not just a lady, but a princess, the Princess Rune Venus of Rushtaria to be more precise.\nSo while those two head back to the castle with the princess, Katsuhiko and Nanami each find their own paths. Katsuhiko hooks up with the queen of the bug-people that were after the princess, and he thoroughly impresses her with his remarkable ability for deception and evilness. He quickly becomes their ruler, implementing one fiendish scheme after another. Nanami, on the other hand, joins a group of travelers and uses her entrepreneurial spirit (along with some soy sauce seasoning which doesn't exist in El-Hazard) to go into business for herself.\nIt's not long before Makoto and Mr. Fujisawa set out on an adventure in search of information that would allow them to go home again, and their guide on this journey is Alielle Relryle, a pretty young lady with purple hair and a diamond shaped mark on her forehead. The trio makes both friends and enemies along their trek, and they're shocked to find that their main enemy is none other than Katsuhiko. And later, they're all shocked to learn that Nanami is here in this world with them. So while Katsuhiko is happy staying in this world attempting to obtain ultimate power, the rest search for a way to get them all home.\nThis is a fun anime to watch, with enjoyably quirky characters, action, adventure, comedy, and a bit of romance. The visuals aren't as clear and crisp as modern day anime, so it was made over 10 years ago, but that doesn't really matter as like many of the older, classic anime series, this one has a lot of personality to it. The new DVD release from \n packs all 5 discs into a case the size of a standard DVD case, which is simply amazing. Those box sets can take up a lot of room on the shelf, even when they use the slimline cases, so I think all box sets should start going this route." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct 6, 1995–Mar 29, 1996" ], "title" : [ "El-Hazard: The Wanderers" ], "company" : [ "TV Tokyo" ], "director" : [ "Katsuhito Akiyama" ], "released" : [ "26 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Afura Mann" }, { "name" : "Masamichi Fujisawa" }, { "name" : "Alielle Relrye" }, { "name" : "Miz Mishtal" }, { "name" : "Ifurita" }, { "name" : "Nanami Jinnai" }, { "name" : "Katsuhiko Jinnai" }, { "name" : "Rune Venus" }, { "name" : "Makoto Mizuhara" }, { "name" : "Shayla Shayla" } ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Fantasy" ] } }

Saban has combined the 100 sequel episodes (52 of Gatchaman II and 48 of Gatchaman Fighter) to create 65 dubbed episodes, with the most emphasis on the weapons and vehicles from Gatchaman II. On the week of September 9th, 1996, Saban's Eagle Riders premiered on US televison, and ran until Fall of 1997. This marks the end of the series run in the United States, but Saban still plans to continue the series in Europe and Australia.\nThe first thirteen episodes were a nearly straight translation of Gatchaman II with a few embellishments and the following differences:\nFirst, the soundtrack was completely replaced. The new background music is intrusive and doesn't compare to Hoyt Curtin's work in BotP, but it is an improvement over the original G-II background music.\nSecond, a few of the explicitly violent scenes were cut, but not enough to make any difference. Most of the clipped scenes involved destruction shots that included innocent bystanders. Saban also cut out any scenes with personal violence. No one with a name was allowed to die in Eagle Riders, while G-II and Fighter were notoriously deadly to guest characters.\nThird, the Vorak goons are \"androids.\" The original Gallactors (with only one or two exceptions) are not. Apparently we still have to protect kidvid from the serious aspects of war.\nFourth, one good thing going for this series was its allusions to events that happened before the Eagle Riders storyline took place. It was hinted that the Eagle Riders had been battling the Vorak before the currently storyline started, and that something horrible had happened to Joe at the end of the first battle. Berg Katse, chief villain in Gatchaman, was referred to in Eagle Riders as \"Lukan.\"\n\nFifth, at the beginning of Gatchaman II, \n (\n) returns to Earth, smashes through a cruise ship and kidnaps a six year old girl which he mutates into the villainess, \n (\n). This was cut out of the beginning of Eagle Riders, then brought back later in the series (not shown in the US).\nSixth, why does \n look female yet have a male voice? Oddly enough, in Gatchaman II, a male actor did \n's voice, and the effect was just as weird. The new voice, by R. Martin Klein, is a close match to the original, but for some reason, \n is said to be male. The character then switches to female later on (complete with female voice) for reasons not quite explained by Saban (again, not shown in the US). The comedic treatment of \n (think Rita Repulsa) seems to fit better in Eagle Riders than Gatchaman II.\nFinally, Saban cut out some of the episodes and set up a new order for the others. Only thirteen of these episodes ran in the United States, while the remaining 52 episodes were run in Europe and Australia. If there is any hope for a further US release, it will be on cable. Unfortunately, it appears this is as good as it gets. I had the opportunity to preview some of the later episodes in July, 1997. They were a major disappointment.\nAnd now for the story for this version. Earth is under siege from the alien menace known only by the name Cybercon, and its legion of android forces, the Vorak. The Global Security Council convenes to address this problem, and calls upon \n for assistance. They remember the aid they had received from Keane's special force, the Eagle Riders, in years past. Keane assures them that the Eagle Riders are still together, still strong, and armed with brand new weapons...." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Oct 1, 1978–Sept 23, 1979" ], "creator" : [ "Tatsuo Yoshida" ], "company" : [ "Gallerie International", "Tatsunoko Prod." ], "title" : [ "Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman II", "Science Ninja Team Gatchaman II", "Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman Fighter", "Science Ninja Team Gatchaman Fighter" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/battle_of_the_planets/index.htm", "name" : "Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/g-force/index.htm", "name" : "Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gatchaman/index.htm", "name" : "Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/gatchaman_1994/index.htm", "name" : "Gatchaman (1994 Remake)" } ], "released" : [ "52 TV episodes", "48 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/x.htm", "name" : "Sosai X" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/katse.htm", "name" : "Berg Katse" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/nambu.htm", "name" : "Dr. Kozaburo Nambu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/mallanox.htm", "name" : "Gelsadora" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/ken.htm", "name" : "Ken Washio" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/jinpei.htm", "name" : "Tsubakuro no Jinpei" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/joe.htm", "name" : "Joe Asakura" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/ryu.htm", "name" : "Ryu Nakanishi" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/eagle_riders/jun.htm", "name" : "Shiratori no Jun" } ], "genre" : [ "Sci-Fi", "Action" ] } }

In total the animated UY had produced 195 TV episodes, 6 movies, 9 original animated videos, and a few other releases to boot. It was, and still is regarded as one of the most popular anime series of all time. One that speaks to my generation in a way few other anime can.\nThe comedy was originally created by renowned female manga-ka Rumiko Takahashi and featured in Shounen Sunday Comics. It is probably the most bizarre and arguably the funniest show there has ever been. Like with most of Takahashi-sensei's manga titles, it is chock full of slapstick and physical comedy. But also as is with all of her series, she blends this edgy comedy with ludicrous situations, lovable characters, a unique brand of drama and lots of punnery. Takahashi went on to create other great hits such as \n and \n. UY was her first big hit and consequently her most ingeniously creative body of work.\nOver here on western shores, the manga series is being translated by Viz Comics using the title \"The Return of Lum*Urusei Yatsura\" and the television series, movies and OVAs are being released in North America by AnimEigo.\n\nUrusei Yatsura concerns the tempestuous relationship between two focal characters: \n who is possibly the most unfaithful, unlucky and lecherous idiot to have ever been born...and there's \n, a tiger skin-bikini clad alien package of sex appeal, jealousy and electricity who's fallen for him. The series chronicles the misadventures of these two stubborn teenagers along with a veritable entourage of weird characters. Among these characters is the richest boy on the planet, a superhuman schoolgirl, a fire-breathing baby, a powerful priestess/school nurse, a cute and psychotic alien vixen with a split personality, a gender-bending martial artist, an alien biker chick, an ice queen of Neptune, a deranged monk, a giant ghost cat and hundreds of other lunatic personalities; aliens, humans and inhumans alike interact in endless hysteria in a town named Tomobiki (the namesake of this site if you haven't figured it out).\nThe series includes a lot of parody of the science-fiction genre. But more than just sci-fi, Urusei Yatsura pokes fun at everything under the sun, from film and television clichés to ancient legends and lore. It is a melting pot of love triangles, fantasy, Japanese and Chinese mythology, high school life, pop-culture and so much more. It's the type of show where literally anything will happen so there's something for everyone to enjoy. The anime undergoes a dramatic changes throughout it's long run as it starts out with fairly simple animation and slowly builds towards an exceptional level of quality unmatched by any other TV show from its era. Yet it is consistent in the way that it is always well worth watching. It's silly and whimsical but at the same moment it's not juvenile at all, it actually has a kind of sophistication to it. I honestly believe that it is the greatest anime and manga series to have ever come out of Japan and after exploring this expansive web site I call Tomobiki-cho, I hope you too will come to realize the sheer brilliance of Urusei Yatsura." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1981–1986" ], "creator" : [ "Rumiko Takahashi" ], "company" : [ "Kitty Films" ], "title" : [ "Urusei Yatsura", "Those Obnoxious Aliens" ], "director" : [ "Mamoru Oshii" ], "released" : [ "195 TV episodes, 9 OVA volumes, 6 movies" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/urusei_yatsura/ataru.htm", "name" : "Ataru Moroboshi" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/urusei_yatsura/oyuki.htm", "name" : "Oyuki" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/urusei_yatsura/lum.htm", "name" : "Lum" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/urusei_yatsura/shutaro.htm", "name" : "Shutaro Mendou" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/urusei_yatsura/lum.htm", "name" : "Lum's Mother" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/urusei_yatsura/ten.htm", "name" : "Ten-chan" } ] } }

Hm, kinda sounds like alternate dimensions to me, but the narrator dude on the DVD says \"worlds\", so I guess \"worlds\" it is. Anyway, so along with the human world, these worlds, called the Makai (the demon world) and the Jujinkai (the half-human, half-beast world), are about to become the target of an ancient prophesy, which states that every 3000 years a being called the Chojin (also known as the Overfiend) is brought to life through a human to unite these three worlds. I see... every 3000 years, huh? So shouldn't these three worlds already be united then? Or do we all just keep separating them after they're united. If so, you'd think they stop waiting an entire 3000 years before uniting them.\n\nAt any rate, the Jujinkai world had sent a couple of warriors to Earth about 300 years ago to start looking for the human who is to become the Overfiend. Amano Jacku, and his super short skirt wearing sister, Megumi, have thus far had no luck finding this guy, and are getting discouraged. Now, each of them thinks that they have finally found their man. Amano feels for certain that it's Ozaki, star of the high school basketball team and Mister popular with all the ladies. Megumi, on the other hand, thinks it's a clumsy perverted peeping tom named Magumo. Who is right? Who do you think....\n\nBefore either one of them can find the answer, a little situation happens involving Akemi and one of her teachers, Ms. Togami. Magumo spies them walking together, and follows them to an empty classroom, where Ms. Togami starts to take advantage of our sweet innocent Akemi. And all the while, Magumo watches with shock through a crack in the door. Eventually, though, he decides to rush in and save Akemi, but just before hie can, Amano shows up and stops him. And it's a good thing, too, since Ms. Togami happens to be a demon in disguise. Shedding her human body, Ms. Togami uses all over her available tentacles on Akemi, but upon seeing this, Amano steps in and confronts the beast. After the battle, Akemi awakes to find Magumo watching over her, and lucky for him, she thinks he saved her.\n\nThere is some sexual content here, although it's much less graphic that your standard hentai series, like those from \n for instance. Yeah, there is sex involving monsters with tentacles, but no penetration is actually shown, nor is any full frontal nudity that's not hidden in shadows. In fact, this DVD is only rated NC-17, a far cry from the X or XXX rating one might expect from anime tentacle porn. No where on the DVD or the DVD case does it state that this is an edited version of the film, but I have my suspicions.\n\nWith those suspicions in mind, I decided to do a little research, and what I discovered was that Urotsukidoji was actually originally a 5 part OVA series. Ah! That explains why this film felt so disconnected with itself. I mean, after watching it I couldn't help but think that they had hired three separate teams and told them to each work on one section of the movie. So finding out that it was actually the first 3 of the 5 separate episodes edited down and spliced together made me feel much better, especially since I found this film to be confusing and boring. I really think keeping them as separate episodes with breaks would have been much more effective for holding my interest.\n\nOh, and you know what else made this even worse? It has both and English language track and the original Japanese language track, but absolutely no subtitles! So in order to know what was going on, I had to watch the dubbed version. The acting for Amano, Megumi, and their servant Kuroko were pretty good, Magumo was alright, and everyone else just wasn't. It was quite difficult to listen to it in English and still try to pay attention to what was going on. C'mon guys, how much work does it take to do some subtitling? Seriously! Not difficult, people. Not difficult at all, especially for a classic piece of work such as this. The good news is that Urotsukidoji: Perfect Collection takes care of all these problems.

In this remake of the classic 1984 cartoon series and toyline, both the Autobots and Decepticons are fighting in order to gain control of a special artifact known as the Allspark. This is the life-giving force of the Transformers, however the Decepticons have intentions of using it for their own sinister purposes. The Allspark has fallen to Earth, bringing the battle of these two robotic factions to our world.\nThe Decepticons make their first strike when Blackout, a Decepticon disquised as a Military helicopter decimates an American Military base in the deserts of Qatar. A group of surviving soldiers become hunted by a Decepticon while trying to warn the U.S. of the threat. Meanwhile in America, a teenager named Sam Witwicky is preparing for the day most teenagers long for, their first car. However, in a strange turn of events he ends up with a rusted 1976 Camaro.\nSoon he discovers that its really an Autobot named Bumblebee. Sam unwitingly holds the key to the Allspark, which makes Sam a target for the Decepticons. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime arrive on Earth in order to find the Allspark, protect Sam and defeat the Decepticons. However the Decepticons are preparing to awaken the evil Megatron, who is held by a secret government organization. In this battle for the powerful Allspark, all hell is about to break loose....\nThis film is based on the 1980s cartoon series which has spun off into various other cartoons and anime. The original voice actor for Optimus Prime has returned to reprise his role. In both the U.S. and Japanese versions, Peter Cullen is once again playing Optimus and Tessho Genda will return as \"Convoy\" in the Japanese dub of the film." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "August 4, 2007" ], "title" : [ "Transformers" ], "company" : [ "United International Pictures" ], "related" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/transformers/index.htm", "name" : "Tatakae!

Anyway, a group of teenage kids are a bit peeved by this, and decide kick up a bit of trouble. Unfortunately, one of these kids, Asap Suzuki, takes things a bit too far when he actually fires a rocket!\nNow wanted by the US military, Asap, who we learn is the son of a big-wig Japanese military officer, flees for his freedom... and winds up in the ocean as the waters suddenly and drastically rise. A giant light then causes one of the giant battleships to begin floating in midair. Asap was able to grab hold before it left the water, but now he finds himself on a flying battleship, and face to face with a beautiful girl who says she is the princess of a world called Byston Well.\nThe girl's name is Lyukus, and her boots have little wings that can pop out, allowing her to fly. She then says \"My father is Japanese, Shinjiro Sakomizu. Please help me, Asap Suzuki\", to which Asap replies \"I'm the Magical Man from Happy-Land, in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane!\"... okay, so that last quote came from The Simpons, but her quote is legit. Somehow this alien girl knows his name. Talk about weird. So then, US military aircraft start attacking the spaceship... oh yeah, did I mention the spaceship? Well, there's a spaceship. Or multiple spaceships. And then a portal appears which sucks everyone in, including the battlship and aircraft, taking them to new an alien world, where ships look like bugs. Now everyone is confused, including the audience.\nSo now that Asap and Lyukus are on Byston Well, they are joined by a fairy named Ferario, and everyone is ticked off that Lyukus took her boots to Earth. What? They want her to go barefoot? The boots, as I'm sure you can guess, are the Wings of Rean, and they are supposed to be used to control a kingdom or something. I don't know, I really didn't get this part (like I got the rest of it?), but at any rate, the boots are special somehow, and not just in the fact that they can make the wearer fly. Oh, and you know how Asap was kind of rebelling against his military dad? Well, Lyukus is rebelling against her father, who is the king, because he became a bad guy or something.

Unfortunately for Michiko, she doesn't have any clue as to what kind of mistake she is about to make!\n\nWhen Keiko is delevered the news, we find her in a stall of the ATV television station women's restroom, masturbating with no restraint. At first she's annoyed at being interuppted, but as soon as she hears the good news, she immidiately strips off her clothes and tosses them over the stall door, into the shocked hands of the messenger. Then out she bolts, all the way down the hall and through the offices, running seemingly faster than a jet plane, and all while wearing only her underwear. But hey, she has to get ready! No time to waste!\n\nAs Keiko is about to go live on the air, Michiko waits anxiously with her little portable television to see how it's going to play out.

Of course, it's hard to say who was more surprised, Michiko or all the viewers. One things for sure, the executives at the station sure aren't happy! Too bad the chairmain liked it, as he just bumped up Keiko's to take over Michiko's position permanently!\n\nKeiko's plan works like a charm! The ratings skyrocket, and Keiko not only becomes the new weather report girl, but the star of the once failing TV station, leaving Michiko completely devastated! Ah, but Michiko isn't going to take this lying down... she has a plan to force Keiko off the air. I won't tell you what the plan is, just that it backfires, causing poor Yamagishi more than a bit of discomfort, and a lot of embarassment. Who is Yamagishi? He's a guy who just got hired on to help out, but his relationship with Keiko actually go back to high school. I shouldn't say anymore than that... best you just watch for yourself.\n\nSo after Keiko gets revenge on Michiko, she forces Michiko to become what she calls her personal \"assistant\", though the term slave or servant would be more appropritate. It's either that or get fired, and Michiko can't afford to start her career all over again. Thus, she contacts Samejima, a reporter she met at the wedding, for some help with her situation. This reporter has made some associates... the kind of associates that will do bad things to someone for the right price. Too bad Keiko is a martial arts expert!

And what better way to release this gem than to give the deluxe treatment, with a three DVD box set containing two episodes (and super-cute science lessons) per disc, newly translated English subtitles for each episode, and a 24-page color booklet containing episode summaries, character profiles and sketches, mech info and sketches, and the staff and cast credits.\nGunbuster is the first anime series I ever rented from a video store, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. Of course, it being a great mini-series also helps. It pretty much embodies exactly what people think, or at least used to think, when they heard the word anime: girls in tight clothes, giant robots, starships, aliens, and space battles. But Gunbuster also includes real emotional content. Friends change... they grow older, and some die... and it all matters. It isn't just brushed over as something that happens. It is dealt with.\n\nGunbuster, named for one of the giant mech robots in the series, tells the story of Noriko Takaya, a cute young woman who is desperately trying to follow in her father's giant footsteps. And what giant footsteps they were, as her father, Admiral Yuzo Takaya, was commander of Earth's first faster-than-light ship called the \n... and nearly his entire fleet perished during an alien attack. There were a few survivors... however, Noriko's father wasn't one of them.\n\nSo now Noriko is training to become a mech pilot, but she lacks even the most basic piloting skills that most of the other girls already have. Luckily for her, Koichiro Ohta, a coach at Okinawa Girls Space Pilot High School (and a survivor of the incident that claimed Admiral Takaya's life), takes her under his wing to personally train her... or is it lucky for her? Now all the other girls thinks she's getting special treatment... can nothing go right for this poor girl!\n\nWell apparently Koichiro, AKA \"coach\", sees raw talent in her, and after a bit of one-on-one training, he is able to bring it out of her. Although still far from being the best student pilot in the school, she is nonetheless chosen as a pilot candidate for the Top Squadron, along with the extremely talented Kazumi Amano. Seems Noriko's dream is actually starting to come true, as the two of them head off for space, but knowing not of what awaits ahead.\n\nIt's not long before she meets new friends aboard the massive space battleship \n... and winds up fighting in her first real battle against the space monsters! I wish I could say she kicked some major space monster butt, however at this point just surviving would seem to be a major accomplishment for our inexperienced rookie. Unfortunately, simply surviving might not be enough. She's going to have to find a way to pull herself together if she's going to conquer the trials to come.\n\nAnd battles aren't even the only thing to fear in space! Time is all relative, so when traveling at near light speeds, time progresses at a different rate than those standing still, so what is a quick 5 minutes at near light speed for Noriko and Kazumi ends up being months back at the Exelion, or years on Earth. How does one reconcile the fact that five minutes ago you were at the same level as the rest of your Top Squadron class, and now all of a sudden they're all ready to graduate? Or that your best friend from back in high school is now a middle age woman with a daughter?\n\nWell, one thing's for sure... things are only going to get worse! Enormous alien fleets, extreme time distortion, and high-running emotions... Noriko and Kazumi are going to have to pull out all the stops and use the hopefully invincible giant robot Gunbuster to save the Earth, and humanity, from total annihilation! Thank goodness for those ultra-cutesy science lessons in between each episode to smooth out the intensity of the series. And unlike other shows, these shorts actually serve and informational purpose, explaining clearly about the science and physics of the series, as well as enlightening us on the largely unknown space monsters. Without these funny little snippets, following the series would have probably been a much more challenging task!", "Gunbuster tells the story of Noriko Takaya, a girl training to become a robot pilot in the midst of a massive intergalactic war. She hopes to follow the footsteps of her famous father, Admiral Yuzo Takaya. She befriends fellow student Kazumi Amano and undergoes various trials and tribulations on her way to the top, and with help from Coach Ota and the rest of Noriko's friends she finally becomes the pilot of the insanely powerful robot known as Gunbuster.\nThe Earth and the entire Solar system has fallen under war from a mysterious and massive alien threat that places humanity in jeopardy. Noriko and Kazumi soon travel to space to prepare and combat the alien threat, however the horrors of the war and the consequences of space travel create unimaginable trials and tragedies for Noriko.\nWill Noriko and Kazumi find the courage and confidence to combat the alien threat and protect their loved ones?

The black and white series was created, animated and produced by Osamu Tezuka (1928-1989) through his own company named Mushi Productions. Tezuka, like his father, was a qualified doctor of medicine but was more interested in drawing. Astroboy was a successful comic strip in Japan in the 1950's. It was released in Japan between 1963 and 1966 and was shown on Melbourne TV in April 1966 at 5:30pm Sunday's on channel 0. The tv week described it as \"Cartoon adventure series about a youngster in the 21st century.\" It was the first animated TV series to be produced in Japan, and after becoming a worldwide hit, Japanese cartoons began to flood the market with the release of other successful series' such as \n, \n and \n. The large oval eyes became the standard for most other Japanese cartoons. A total of 193 episodes were produced, but only 104 of them were redubbed and shown on TV outside Japan.\nThe voice of \n and \n was Billie Lou Watt (who was female, not male as many people believe). She later went on to be Kimba and \n from \n. The voice of \n was Cliff Owen who also played \n from \n and Dan'l Baboon from \n. Gilbert Mack was the voice of \n as well as Dick Strong from \n and Pauley Cracker from \n.\nPeter Fernandez wrote more than half of the English scripts and many others were written by the voice cast members. Peter was paid $100 to $125 per episode- the same fee that he was later paid by Fred Ladd for \n.\nFred Ladd directed the English version and wrote some of the scripts. Ladd said that \"Astro Boy began with Mushi's #1, and generally stayed in Mushi's sequence, but we had to reject 6 of their shows, for various reasons: one dealt with vivisection (unacceptable here as kids' content at the time); one dealt with a bachelor who had pictures of nude women hanging on his walls; one (Christ's Eyeballs) dealt with a criminal hiding out in a church and scratching a secret message to his cohorts on the eyeballs of a statuette of Christ, (in Buddhist Japan, nobody at the studio objected).\"\nIn 1982 a colored version was released and shown in Melbourne throughout the 1980's. In 1996 it was shown here on cable TV. Many of these episodes are available on video in Pal format through Siren Entertainment and are still enjoyed by young children today.\nThe series begins in the year 2000 with the death of Dr Boynton's (a robotics engineer) son Astor (Toby in the first remake) in a car accident (help with some character names from Dave Sternberg). He makes a robot in his son's image, but disappointed that he's not a real boy he disowns him, and he is sold to a robot circus and here is named \n. The ringmaster Cachatore (Hamegg in the new series) treats him cruelly, but he is later rescued by \n (large nose and two puffs of hair on the sides of his head) who is against slavery of robots. Under his guidance, \n embarks on adventures, fighting anything that threatens mankind. \n can fly using jet rocket propulsion; has weapons including a lazer and machine gun, and has emotions. \n, like most of the other robots, lives by the robot law that orders robots to help mankind by doing what's good.\nOther characters in the series included \n who was a friend of \n's (renamed \n in the colored series because of his long moustache), \n (named \n in the color series) made by \n as \n sister. \n bigger brother was named Jetto. He was stored away in the warehouse of the Science Academy and was created by Dr. Boynton as a prototype of \n. One of \n's main enemies is \n who was a boy robot but was rebuilt into a highly intelligent and powerful robot. \n is sometimes a secret agent and in some episodes is also Judo Expert (as this fact is demonstrated in the Blackie Young episode). He retains the boastful loudmouth qualities of \n but actually is portayed in the new series as a courageous individual as opposed to a cowardly braggard in the older Astroboy series.\nThe \n character in the New Astroboy is a somewhat less of a scholar and actually more of a foolish \"Absent Minded professor\", rather than the learned man that we see heading up \"The Institute of Science\". (Info on \n from Dave Sternberg)\nSome of the episodes include \"Funnel To The Future\" where \n, \n and \n are sent 70,000 years into the future; \"Mystery Of The Metal Men\" where \n is blown away into a parallel world, and \"Gangor The Monster\" where 46 wrestling robots join together to form a giant centipede. The lost episode, titled \"The Beast from 20 Fathoms\", was created in 1963, and only two copies were made. The Japanese version was destroyed as Osamu Tezuka was unhappy with it. The other copy was sent to America for dubbing and is the only version that exists today.\nThe following information is written by Mark Cannon from Canberra Australia who has picked up some interesting points after watching Astroboy episodes again after nearly 30 years.\nThanks Mark." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1963–1966" ], "creator" : [ "Osameu Tezuka" ], "company" : [ "Mushi Prod.", "Screen Gems", "Video Promotions" ], "title" : [ "Tetsuwan Atom" ], "released" : [ "104 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/friends.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/nikki.htm", "name" : "Nikki" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/astroboy.htm", "name" : "Tetsuwan Atom" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/skunk.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/astrogirl.htm", "name" : "Uran" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/friends.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/atlas.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Tobio Tenma" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/walrus.htm", "name" : "Mr. Pompus" }, { "name" : "Dr. Nagamiya Tenma" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/elefun.htm", "name" : "Dr. Ochanomizu" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/jump.htm", "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/astro_boy/livian.htm", "name" : "--?--" } ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Mecha" ] } }

No robots or monsters or spaceships or alternate dimensions are to be found at the center of the story, as this series is all about relationships and everyday life. I know, saying it like that kinda makes it sound boring, but surprisingly it's not. Each character has something about them that makes you care and want to learn more.\nIn the first episode, we see that Akarai had been friends with Hiroyuki ever since they were both little kids. Now they are both starting a new semester at high school, and although they are still both good friends to each other, it seems like Akari might want to be more than friends with Hiroyuki. Of course, Hiroyuki is oblivious to this, and Akarai isn't the outgoing type who would just go up and confront him about it.\nIn the second episode, a popular Japanese rock band known as \"Childish An Hour\" comes to town. Hiroyuki and Akarai, and their friends Masashi and Shiho all express an interest in going... only problem is, there are no more tickets available. But then somehow Shiho manages to snag two tickets through a music store where his big sister used to work, and thus now has the dilemma of choosing who gets to go.\nIn the third episode, Hiroyuki unintentionally befriends a quiet mysterious girl named Serika Kurusugawa. Serika is a member of the school's Occult Club... or I should say the \n member of the school's Occult Club. When she speaks, it is never more audible than a whisper, making it difficult-to-impossible for us to hear what she's saying. Thankfully, Hiroyuki repeats what she says before responding, so we don't have to be subjected to one-sided conversations whenever she's around.\nIn the fourth episode (and the final one on the first DVD), we are introduced to a new girl, Aoi. She is attempting to get people interested in her new extreme martial arts club, but everyone just seems to shrug her off. Somehow she is able to convince good ole Hiroyuki to try it out... I'm sure it didn't hurt that she was a cute girl. Then one day Akarai and Shiho decide to follow him and check out his practice, but they end up witnessing a confrontation between Aoi and her rival, Yoshie Sakashita, who is a member of the Karate Club.\nThe DVD contains a few extra features, such as character bios, translation notes (my favorite), line art gallery, trailers, and a reversible cover. It also has both English and Japanese dialog, and optional English subtitles. Oh, and Dolby Digital audio. All-in-all, not a bad release at all, especially for a series that I wasn't expecting to like.", ", also referred to as \n, is about a high school boy named Hiroyuki Fujita, who is rather lucky at befriending girls. He has one male friend, named Masashi, but his other friends are a group of girls.\nThe anime is calm, laid-back, and easy to follow. Most of the episodes depict common things, such as everyday duties, seating arrangements in class, clean up duty, etc. It's short, nothing to reach out and grab you, and no real thrill, but it is nice to sit and watch." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "April 1, 1999" ], "title" : [ "To Heart" ], "company" : [ "KSS", "Inc Oriental Light And Magic" ], "released" : [ "13 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/to_heart/akari.htm", "name" : "Akari Kamigishi" }, { "name" : "Masashi" }, { "name" : "Ayaka Kurusugawa" }, { "name" : "Miyauchi Lemmy" }, { "name" : "Himekawa Kotone" }, { "name" : "Serika Kurusugawa" }, { "name" : "Hiroyuki Fujita" }, { "name" : "Shiho" }, { "name" : "Hoshina Tomoko" }, { "name" : "Yoshie Sakashita" } ], "genre" : [ "Comedy", "Drama", "Romance" ] } }

A quick peek inside reveals the hot green-haired student Hotaru pleasing herself to thoughts of a professor. So it's no surprise that Professor Ayabe jumps when another student, the pink-haired Sakura, comes up behind him. It's also no surprise that Professor Ayabe declines to walk out with her, saying that he has some things he still has to finish up. But as soon as she leaves, before our excited little professor even has time to turn around, the doors to the room open and a pair of arms pulls him right inside! And we all know that in hentai titles, resistance if futile! Though it's not like he really resisted.... Anyway, unbeknownst to Professor Ayabe, Hotaru was getting the whole thing on video!\n\nWhy, you ask? For blackmail of course! Is there ever any other reason? But it's not Hotaru who's doing the blackmail, it's the sexy, dominating Professor Kyomoto. What's she up to?! Well for some reason, she wants to blackmail Professor Ayabe into taking some young women that she specifies and then having sex with them while getting it all on video. Okay... kind of a strange demand. Well, with little choice for fear of losing his job and being humiliated in front of the entire school, he does what he is told. His first target is the petite young blond-haired Miku Mikuni whom he finds and trains in a public restroom stall. Gee, I wonder how it goes? Does she at first resist and then start to enjoy it? The next applicant is the purple-haired priestess Kotoe Yasaku. She's tied up, and is pleasured by candlelight. How romantic.\n\nThe next day Professor Ayabe comes across Sakura working at a fast food restaurant. The lovely young lady obviously has a crush on our dear professor, so eventually she gets up the courage to ask him out on a date to the aquarium. Well, they both have a lovely time, but afterward Ayabe has to return to his duties. His subject: the brown-haired glasses-wearing Ayumi, lesbian lover of Hikaru, whom together make up the singing group Birds. The place: an empty room at the school. The assistance: Miku Mikuni, who is now a sexed-up female cat-girl wanna-be who even has her own cat-ears and tail. The blackmail: do what Ayabe says or the world will find out about the Birds' lesbian love affair. Hey, you think she resists at first resist and then starts to enjoy it? Yeah, real imaginative there.\n\nWell, soon afterwards we finally get to find out what Professor Kyomoto is up to... she's preparing the girls to be sold out as sex slaves. And the first customer? The Director, one of the ugliest men you have ever seen. Fat, hairy, sweaty, and extremely controlling, this monstrosity of a man tries out Kyomoto's pet, Hotaru. Or should I say, ex-pet, since she was actually trying to steal the tape to get Professor Ayabe off the hook. But since she failed and got caught, she became the Director's. It wasn't a pretty sight, by any means, and defineitly a far cry from the handsome Ayabe or the sexy Kyomoto. But when you're a sex slave, you don't really have much say in the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Professor Ayabe-land, we find him walking in the rain at night, when out of nowhere he is struck by a car. He awakes in a hospital to the sight of a beautiful blue-haired nurse, as well as Hotaru, who has been waiting in the room with him. How sweet! He soon discovers that the person who hit him was none other than his doctor, the beautiful assistant chief surgeon Dr. Manami Sugisaki. Apparently the nurse has a thing for the doctor, since she tries to bribe the professor to not press charges. Any guess on what his conditions are for not revealing the secret? Well, if not, you'll get to see it, complete with Miku Mikuni and Kotoe Yasaku, who just can't get enough. Eh? What about Ayumi you say? Nah, she was there earlier, under the covers while the nurse was trying to buy him off. Dang, can a man really be that good?! Yep, but only in hentai....\n\nAnyway, I don't want to tell you how it ends, but suffice to say Professor Ayabe and Sakura have to have their confrontation. Also, we get a glimpse at another side of our dear professor, with a little surprise at the end. So no, the story's not anything complex or mind-bending, and definitely nothing we haven't seen before in other hentai titles. But on the other hand, there are some good angles, and the art and animation are both well done. Plus, there is very rarely any re-used scenes, if any, like is typical with other titles. So overall, there's nothing outstanding here that makes it a must-see, but it can holds its own in the arena of hentai titles." ], "jp_info" : { "title" : [ "Temptation" ], "company" : [ "Discovery", "Scoop" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Ayumi" }, { "name" : "Kotoe Yasaku" }, { "name" : "Director" }, { "name" : "Miku Mikuni" }, { "name" : "Dr. Sugisaki" }, { "name" : "Professor Ayabe" }, { "name" : "Hikaru" }, { "name" : "Professor Kyomoto" }, { "name" : "Hotaru" }, { "name" : "Sakura" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

In class, she'll wear outfits such as the one we first see her in, a lustful red suit with a short miniskirt and a shirt that reveals not just her cleavage, but part of her fancy lace bra as well. It's no wonder the tardy Togawa, an arrogant male student, decides to feel her up right in the middle of class. Too bad for Togawa, Miss Ayaka is an expert in martial arts! A quick kick to the face puts Togawa on the ground, and gives the whole class a nice view of her violet lace panties. It's too bad Professor Saiyo doesn't have Professor Ayaka's confidence and martial arts skills. After class, she comes crying to Ayaka about a student that keeps touching her.\nAyaka isn't just a martial arts master, she's also a teacher in the martial arts club. Later that afternoon we find her in the dojo during practice. She's helping out one white-belt student in particular, trying to get his stance correct. But her hands-on technique is too much for a young adolescent boy to bear, and he develops an embarrassing issue below the belt. Ayaka, being the bold woman that she is, decides to help him out with his issue... right there in the middle of the rest of the students' practice! How does she get away with this? Well, I'm sure it helps that her dad is the chairman.\n\nAfterwards, Togawa's older brother, who happens to be captain of the Karate Club, approaches Ayaka to apologize for his little brother's behavior. He then challenges her to a friendly little sparring match. How he is not distracted by the fact that she's wearing a loose fitting karate uniform with no bra, I will never know, but his concentration doesn't seem to make any difference in the match as he quickly learns he's not all that... at least not compared to the skilled Ayaka. Her moves seem downright reflexive!\n\nAnyway, a bit later on we find Ayaka retire to the vacant gym showers so that she can have a little alone time playing with herself. Somehow, Togawa finds his way in there as well, and decides to join in on her fun, despite her verbal protests. I say verbal because she those were the only kind of protests she made. She didn't stop doing what she was doing when he walked in on her, she didn't try to cover up, and she made no effort to stop him from joining in. Of course, when it was over, she reflexively gave him a hard karate kick which knocked him silly. And that's when Togawa's brother somehow walks in on them.\nSo apparently that kick of hers was pretty powerful, as it ended up putting Togawa in the hospital. Of course, he still seemed well enough to blackmail Professor Ayaka into giving him some \"exercise\"... so go figure. And this time, she actually admitted to herself that she enjoyed it." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "May 28, 2004" ], "title" : [ "Sin Kan" ], "released" : [ "1 OVA episode" ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

Originally an unofficial sport, the realm of ruthless groups looking for power and control, that all changed with the establishment of the Zoid Battle Commission, which codified the rules of combat, established official leagues and events, and provided a means of enforcing the rules.

During his battles he encounters a mysterious young man from another planet who helps him out whenever he is in danger.\nReleased in the mid 1980's, Tekkaman the Space Knight received excellent ratings on television in the U.S. and generated lots of positive fan mail. As syndication sales grew, television was suddenly bombarded with toy-driven \"robot series\" including \"\n,\" \"The Transformers,\" \"Go-Bots,\" \"\n,\" \"Silverhawks,\" and more. This flood of bartered (\"free\") programs, all produced by large multi-million dollar corporations, destroyed future sales of Tekkaman (regardless of the good ratings) because at the time William Winckler Productions was a small independent company without a major toy company behind it.\nOver forty-thousand original Tekkaman the Space Knight VHS video cassettes were successfully sold throughout the U.S. to major retail stores by Congress Video Group (the largest video distributer at the time), and later by L.D. Video. Congress Video sold half-hour episodes, whereas L.D. Video sold the two 96-minute movie compilations.\nWinckler attempted to stay as true to the original Japanese series as possible, doing as little editing of violence as possible, and leaving all the original Japanese music and sound effects in. This was very unusual at the time, considering how show's like \"\n\"/\"\n\" were handled.\nIn fact, at the time, Ted Turner was considering buying Tekkaman for his giant cable network, but turned the show down due to the heavy battle scenes." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "July 2, 1975–Dec. 24, 1975" ], "creator" : [ "Kenji Yoshida, Ippei Kuri" ], "company" : [ "Tatsunoko Prod." ], "title" : [ "Uchuu no Kisi Tekkaman", "Space Knight Tekkaman" ], "director" : [ "Hiroshi Sasagawa, Hisayuki Toriumi" ], "released" : [ "26 TV episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Joji Minami" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Hiromi Amachi" }, { "name" : "Hiromi's father" }, { "name" : "--?--" } ] } }

Everyone does their best to keep the river contained, but it quickly overwhelms them, and it becomes all too clear that this is no ordinary storm. Luckily, \n recognizes this just in time to summon \n. He slips her a mysterious item, and instructs her to journey into human world in order to warn \n and the gang and give them the mysterious item. As soon as she takes off, \n is swallowed by currents, and sadly, \n is the only one that is able to make it out of spirit world before the waters cover everything in sight, but at least that means there's still hope for the spirit world.\n\nOn Earth, \n arrives in pretty bad shape. She falls unconscious into \n's arms pretty much as soon as she arrives, and is unable to tell him what happened or give him the mysterious item. Still, it's not long before they discover that the forces of the netherworld are behind this cataclysm, and they quickly devise a plan to find five spots on Earth which contain enormous amounts of spirit energy (and how convenient that they're all located in Tokyo, Japan), and use that energy to restore the spirit world. What the gang doesn't count on is that the bad guys are also tracking down the spiritual spots to release the energy, and that they have a way to convert it all to netherworld energy!\n\nThey discover this just as they reach the first energy point, and must now make the decision to split up in the hopes of preventing the other four energy points from behind overtaken by the netherworld's power! First up is \n and Hinageshi, who go after the elemental site of fire. \n makes quick work of the netherworld demons who are already there, up until he has to go toe-to-toe with Yakumo, king of the netherworld, who ends up taking \n to town without even breaking a sweat. After that defeat, \n then meets \n, one of the three demon gods of the netherworld, who can copy anyone's spiritual moves. And since \n is the weakest fighter of the group, it doesn't really look like his battle for the energy spot is going to pan out in his favor.\n\nMeanwhile, \n quickly dispatches a couple of flying demons that attack, before being knocked silly by some ugly guy who also looks to have a third eye on his forehead. \n, on the other hand, looks like he's going to succeed in securing his elemental site, when someone from his far past appears and destroys it, thus releasing all it's energy. Back over at the \n/\n duel, \n pulls off a clever strategy giving him a fighting chance! But win or lose, we all know that the elemental site is still going to somehow be released of it's energy by the netherworld. I mean, it wouldn't be that exciting of a movie if it didn't end up looking like there was no hope at all for our heros!\n\nFans of the English version television show will notice that all the characters have different voice actors, which is because this movie was dubbed and released by U.S. Manga Corp. before the television show was picked up for a US release. After watching the entire US run of the television series, I have to say that listening to these new voices just doesn't feel right. Luckily the DVD release has both the English dialog and the original Japanese language track with optional English subtitles. And this does feel like a full-blown movie too, not just some extended episode or some made-for-video movie.\nThe animation is much improved from the TV series, though it's still nothing that hasn't been seen before in countless other anime films. Also, you're expected to already be a fan of the series, so there isn't much character development at all. If you're not a fan, it'd be best to check out the TV series first. Once you've spent time with all of these characters and have really gotten to know all their quirks and personalities, then journey back towards this movie and check out their adventure." ], "jp_info" : { "creator" : [ "Yoshihiro Togashi" ], "company" : [ "Studio Pierrot", "Fuji TV" ], "title" : [ "Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Movie" ], "director" : [ "Masakatsu Iijima" ], "released" : [ "1 movie" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/botan.htm", "name" : "Botan" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/koenma.htm", "name" : "Koenma Daioh" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/genkai.htm", "name" : "Genkai" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/kurama.htm", "name" : "Kurama" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/hiei.htm", "name" : "Hiei" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/majari.htm", "name" : "Majari" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/keiko.htm", "name" : "Keiko Yukimura" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/yusuke.htm", "name" : "Yuusuke Urameshi" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/yu_yu_hakusho/kuwabara.htm", "name" : "Kazuma Kuwahara" }, { "name" : "Hinageshi" } ], "genre" : [ "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Fantasy" ] } }

They can crack any case! Okay, that's an unsubstantiated claim... I don't really know that for sure. I don't think they actually mention what their success ratio is... but if you want a pair of detectives with big boogs, then they're definitely the right people to call. Did I mention they have big breasts? Because they do. Think watermelon sized. Anyway, time to move on....\nEnter Yayoi, a petite young thing who is a friend friend of Masafumi's, and who happens to have a crush on him. She also happens to have a new case, something dealing with drugs that make people incoherent so they can be raped... which strikes a chord with Rio. For in her past lies an event involving drugs and rape... and more specifically, it involves her sister. It's a sad tale about a couple guys who caught Rio and her sister, and when they forced the drug on her sister, she died. Thus the reason she became a detective, so that she might come across clues that would help her avenger her sister's death.\n\nSo Yoyoi takes Rio to this relaxation salon where her friend was apparently drugged and then had things done to her, all while they tapped in... and then afterward blackmailed her with the tapes, which caused her friend to attempt suicide. They were there to get information... \"infiltration\" I believed Rio called it... but before they knew what was going on, both Yoyoi and Rio were drugged, rapped and videotaped. \"Thanks to Karen's quick thinking, we were able to escape the worst of it\" is, I believe, Rio's explanation for how they escaped blackmail... which I think is supposed to explain why Yoyoi doesn't know about any of what happened. Seems like a cop-out to me.\n\nBut... Yoyoi does have a feeling that something did happen there, so to explain that Rio makes up a story about how the medicine at the salon made Yoyoi really horny, and that Masafumi helped her out to save her from herself. Yoyoi was excited to here this little bit of fake news... so much so that, later when Masafumi was alone on the roof of a building doing surveillance on an apartment, she came up to chat with him and \"accidentally\" gave him a nice view of her panties. And after that? Well, this is a hentai, so I think you get the idea. Unfortunately, Karen returned to the roof early, so they didn't get to finish.\n\nLater that night, Karen and Masafumi are still on the roof waiting for some cheating guy to enter the apartment so they can catch him in the act. Masafumi is fast asleep when they finally arrive, leaving Karen to man the camera. As she photographs them the couple having passionate sex, she begins to get aroused herself. But pleasuring herself is just not enough, so she enlists Masafumi's help. Masafumi, who was awakend earlier by Karen's sounds, pretends to still be asleep, though he can't keep that up forever.\n\nWhile all that was going on, Rio made some progress on their major case by being able to narrow down who distributes the drug. Unfortunately, before she can continue the investigation, another client comes through the door. This one looks like a typical teenager stoner boy, and he's requesting that they help look for his friend, whom he wants to find quickly because the dude's father is critical condition, and he wants them to see each other just in case ole' daddy takes a turn for the worse. I don't know about you, but sounds kind of suspicious to me.\n\nAnyways, the plot progresses and the sex continues... it's a hentai so you should know the drill. The art, animation, dubbing, and character development are all pretty typical of a standard hentai title made this century. What makes this one a bit different from some others I think is its inclusion of over-sized breasts (yeah, even more than is typical) and breast milk orgasms. Can't say I remember see that before. The ended was left so that a sequel would be easily possible, and I really wouldn't mind seeing some more character development if that were to happen." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "2004" ], "company" : [ "Five Ways" ], "released" : [ "2 OVA episodes" ], "genre" : [ "Hentai" ] } }

Yu had won the fight, but that meant her good friend Sanari had lost. Now Yu is lying on her bed, thoughts drifting to what Sanari had gone through after the fight had ended, right there in the ring in front of all those people. Definitely hard thoughts to bear, but the tournament must move on. Round one, second match is Dianne versus Ayumi, American versus Japanese. The battle is over quickly, with Ayumi prevailing. Dianne, knowing what comes next, quickly scoops up Ayumi and tosses her to Tama, instructing her to get Yu out so she doesn't have to witness the event. Being a tough gal, Dianne tries her best to resist, but she is no match for the men in black suits. Tied and bound, we get to see some interesting sex positions in this scene.\nThe third match of round one is Anna Fairgold versus Kei Sagara. Kei is unsure about the outcome, while Anna seems pretty confident. Once underway, Anna learns there is more to Kei that she first suspected, yet Kei is still no match for Anna's awesome power, and Kei goes down. Before the match began, Kei visited Yu and provided her with a copy of the Dianne versus Ayumi match to help prepare her for the bout against Ayumi. However, after the video of the match is over, something else comes on the screen... it's a message from Kei, warning her of Anna's power. She says that Anna is becoming a monster, but that Yu also has a power deep inside her, a power that can possibly stop Anna.\n\nAnd while this information may matter later on, right now it holds no meaning for the defeated Kei, as it's time for her penalty. Laying unconscious in the ring, the men in black remove her shirt and lube her chest up with some kind of pink goo. Hands come from every direction to rub, squeeze, and fondle until the goop is spread around. Then the skirt comes flying off, and the last of the pink goo is emptied onto her panties. But fear not, my friends, for another bottle of the slime is close at hand. First, however, her panties must come off, going airborne sailing through the air, leaving her completely bare and giving one lucky audience member a souvenir. Once again, there is no shortage of unusual positions in this sex scene.\n\nAfterward, we start to learn a bit more about what is really going on, but there are some real spoilers contained within that information and I don't want to give any of them away. So lets just move on to round one, match number four, Yung Ching Jyu versus Misty. Yung Ching Jyu takes an early lead, but Misty isn't about to give up so easily, and the battle is over almost before it starts, though it seems the loser will have to wait for the next episode to take her punishment. Only one more exciting episode to go before we get to find out what's really going on behind this tournament, but if it's anything like the first two it will be worth watching. Seems like it's been quite a while since I've seen a hentai series that had a legitimate plot such as this." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "Feb 25, 2004" ], "title" : [ "Variable Geo Neo Volume II - Fighters Clash" ], "company" : [ "Milky Animation Label" ], "director" : [ "Ryuuichi Nozaki" ], "released" : [ "1 OVA episode" ], "characters" : [ { "name" : "Anna Fairgold" }, { "name" : "Sanari Misumi" }, { "name" : "Ayumi Okamoto" }, { "name" : "Tama" }, { "name" : "Diane Rian" }, { "name" : "Yuu Asuka" }, { "name" : "Kei Sagara" }, { "name" : "Zhenzhu-Yu" }, { "name" : "Misty" } ], "genre" : [ "Hentai", "Martial Arts" ] } }

Called simply \"\n\" in his series (The Ultraman), \n have dubbed this one \"\n\" (or \"\n\" for short).\nIt all started when the Earth became surrounded by strange colored lights. Then strange, unknown symbols appeared in the air over several major cities. Fearing invasion, the Earth Defense Force put together a special task force, the Science Garrison. One of the members was \n, stationed on an orbiting space station. During \n's travel to Earth, he was intercepted by a ball of light. Suddenly he found himself face-to-face with a being who called himself \"\n,\" from a planet (called Ultarra in some references) in constellation U40. \n informed \n that his planet was about to face great dangers that only he could stop. In order to go to Earth and warn them, however, he had to merge with \n. This he did, although \n thought at first that it was a dream.\nSoon after, prehistoric monsters arrived frozen in icebergs. \n discovered he had a green star-shaped badge in his possession. After failing to stop the beasts, \n heard \n's voice again, telling him to use the Beam Flasher. By placing the Beam Flasher on his forehead, \n would become a human-sized Ultraman, who would then grow to \"normal\" Ultra height (in his case, about 70 meters).\n had more attacks than any other Ultraman, due in no small part to the fact that animation lets a studio do much more without a heavy special effects budget. He had numerous energy-beam type attacks, and like the other Ultras, \n had a ColorTimer on his chest, in this case star-shaped. Unlike the others, his ColorTimer changed from green (okay) to yellow (in trouble) to blinking red (it's now or never!).\nIn the end, \n was rewarded for his defense of Earth by becoming an individual human being.\nCuriously enough, \n was the first of several Ultra-heroes which were never really officially connected to the whole Ultra-mythos. A costume for a live actor was made of \n, and used in several stage shows in Japan, but otherwise \n never appeared with the other Ultra-heroes. In other episodes in the series (and in the English \n), others from \n' home appeared, including \"\n\" (a woman Ultra), \"\n\" (an Ultraman similar in appearance to \n), and \"Erek\" (an Ultraman with shoulder decorations, perhaps indicating leadership). These were friends of \n who were called in to help with an alien invasion. All four were part of an effort to colonize other parts of the galaxy.\nThe Ultraman was released in America in two different forms in the USA. One was the 1982 production The Adventures of Ultraman, which included the first episodes and the last storyline. More recently, several directly-translated episodes have appeared in the US, on a video titled Ultra Man II; here \n was known simply as \"\n.\" The Ultraman also has the distinction of being the first Ultra-series to be shown in Moscow, which happened around 1994.\nThere is also a German translation for the \n movie (when the Humans and Ultarans battle the invaders), which I believe is the first 3 episodes of the series." ], "jp_info" : { "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ultraman/glenn.htm", "name" : "Tobe" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ultraman/pigu.htm", "name" : "Pigu" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ultraman/harris.htm", "name" : "Hikari Choh-iciroh" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ultraman/jonias.htm", "name" : "Ultraman Jonias" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ultraman/heller.htm", "name" : "Heller" }, { "name" : "Amia" }, { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/ultraman/loto.htm", "name" : "Roto" }, { "name" : "Baltan-seijin" } ], "dates" : [ "1979" ], "company" : [ "Tsuburaya Productions" ], "title" : [ "Za Urutoraman" ] } }

The winner is rewarded with glory and money, while the losers hang their heads in shame... and not just because they lost, but because the punishment for losing is to be sexually molested in the ring while the entire crowd cheers it on.\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. Volume one starts off not on Yu, but on some purple haired girl whose hands are bound by a chain to the ceiling. Three men are in the room with her, all of whom are sporting military-like threads, and they apparently want some information that miss busty purple-haired girl has... though even after a few strikes of a whip, she is unwilling to talk. So her captors try another tactic: pouring some gooey gel substance over her now-tender breasts. Apparently it's some kind of truth serum or something. At any rate, off come her clothes and the fun begins.\n\nThe next scene is when we are introduced to Yu Asuka. She's on a train that's leaving for the tournament she spies a girl running beside the train trying to get her attention. This would be Ayumi Akamoto, who is also heading for the tournament. They quickly become friends, and once their off the train they also quickly meet a third contestant in the tournament, a cute Chinese girl named Yung Ching Jyu (but call her Tama-chan!), who literally drops in from above just like you'd expect from a Chinese acrobat in an anime series.\n\nAfter a quick flashback of Yu talking to some old guy known as the Professor (which indicate that this tournament is more than it seems) and some quick introductions, the battles begin! Yu Asuka is up first, squaring off against her good friend Sanari Misumi. The fight is fast and furious, but also quite short. The one who wins moves on to the next round, while the other gets taken right there in front of the entire crowd... and I don't think it would be much of a spoiler to reveal that our main character, Yu Asuka, is the one proceeding to the next round.\nAlthough the battle may be over, the series continues on with volume two and volume three.

Well the Variable Geo Tournament!!!\nIn the near future, the faltering \"Family Restaurant Industry\" began to sponsor fighting tournaments featuring members of their own staff in order to boost their patronage... Thus began the sport of Full contact waitressing. As it quickly becomes known as more of a success than even the most optimistic restaurateur had hoped.\nBut there's more at stake here than prize money and free advertising. The mysterious Jahanna Group, which has marketed the tournaments, has quietly begun to infiltrate the restaurants which feature Full-Contact Waitressing.\nTo enter the tournaments, one must have a sponsoring restaurant (but those who enter can be their own sponsors if they have a restaurant), a will to fight and be female. If any waitresses were to win the entire sectional tournament (each section ending whenever the fighters felt like it and starting the next spring), she would get ten million dollars and her choice of prime real estate in any city she desires. However, losing can often carry the burden of having to put on an embarrassing performance to the victor's whims or possibly even strip naked in front of the viewing audience.\nBecause of these embarrassing costs, not all fighter/waitresses desire to enter the tournament and the tournament has come under fire from some strong critics. So, depending on the level of the victory, one might not have to strip, but they will have to do something asinine and embarrassing. Besides, they may not have a viewing audience as some fights quickly get out of hand.\nDespite the more-than-blatant assaults on the sport and the high risk of embarrassment, there are still many brave waitresses that enter the tournament in hopes of winning the money. Some out of desperation, some out of desire and others because they're secretly exhibitionists. I think the last one is a low probability, but there are such people out there and they might join the sport just to show off.\nAnyway, those who enter the tournaments may battle whenever and whomever they choose, so two tournament fighters would not have to fight were they to meet. Not to mention some don't recognize each other as newbies join every spring and might not fight until later in the season. The Champion of the sectional tournament does not need to battle anyone the next year, save the last remaining warrior who hasn't been eliminated from the tournament.\nThe tournament fighters are called \"VG Warriors\" and carry special cards that allow them to call and challenge each other among other things, such as call up specially-made rings and confirmation poles which confirm that she is a VG Warrior and that she is still active in the tournaments." ], "jp_info" : { "dates" : [ "1996" ], "creator" : [ "Yousuke Kuroda/TGL" ], "company" : [ "Chaos Project", "TGL", "KSS", "Inc" ], "title" : [ "Variable Geo" ], "director" : [ "Toru Yoshida" ], "released" : [ "3 OVA episodes" ], "characters" : [ { "url" : "http://www.absoluteanime.com/variable_geo/manami.htm", "name" : "Manami Kusonoki" }, { "name" : "Miranda Jahana" }, { "name" : "Ayako Yuuki" }, { "name" : "Reimi Jahana" }, { "name" : "Chiho Masuda" }, { "name" : "--?--" }, { "name" : "Elena Goldsmith" }, { "name" : "Saki Shindou" }, { "name" : "Jun Kubota" }, { "name" : "Satomi Yajima" }, { "name" : "Kaori Yanase" }, { "name" : "Tamao Mitsurugi" }, { "name" : "Kyoko Kirishima" }, { "name" : "Yuka Takeuchi" } ], "genre" : [ "Martial Arts" ] } }

So what we've learned so far is that Diane Rian is a actually a secret agent named Rita who is trying to uncover illegal activities. She learns that Fairgold's plan is to create the perfect human weapon, and that this Variable Geo tournament is simply to showcase these human weapons for buyers. Yu Asuka and Anna Fairgold were both created by the professor, who is basically a mad scientist. So they're basically like sisters, but they don't know that. Okay, now on with the story!\nWe come in during the middle of a match... or I should say toward the end of it seeing as how Misty easily defeats Tama-chan by forming some kind of energy ball in her hand. So of course Tama-chan gets punished by being taken right there on stage by a bunch of guys. At first she doesn't mind because she finds the guy hot, but he blindfolds her and when it eventually slips off due to the movement she gets all embarrassed. Kinda odd if you ask me, being okay doing it in front of everyone with a stranger, but becoming embarrassed only because there are multiple guys... but whatever. And of course she ends up loving it.\n\nThe next match is between Yu Asuka and Ayumi Okamoto, but while that's going on Sanari, who is locked in her room, pulls the oldest trick in the book and fakes sick to lure the guards in so she can escape. At first the guards do the right thing and call for a doctor, but then they become morons and enter the room. Why would you do that?! What exactly do you plan to do?! C'mon guys, think this though! Anyway, so she busts out and makes it out to the match to see Yu flat on the mat. After a few shouts of encouragement, Yu is good to go. And while Ayumi has some pretty sweet moves, they're no match for Yu's energy blast.\n\nBad news for Ayumi! Or is it? Just then the lights go dark and Misty swoops in, picks her up, and hauls butt out of the ring, saving Ayumi for her once inevitable fate. Diane Rian also swoops in, but dressed in a tight black body suit instead of her previous uniform, and she pulls Sanari to come with her, and together they barrel through the hallways, with Diane, AKA Rita, really showing off her talents... and even though this is a hentai, I'm shockingly not talking about sex this time. Nope, Rita makes quick work of the guards, dodging their bullets and laying them out cold with some sweet hand-to-hand moves. Then for some reason she decides to throw off her blonde wig, reveal a short silver-haired cut underneath... and before loosing consciousness one of the guards recognizes her as Silvermine.\n\nMeanwhile, we find Misty dropping off Ayumi in Tama's room, and asking Tama to take care of the poor girl. And take care of her she does... and this time I am implying sex. Tama caresses Ayumi's face as she lays there unconscious, commenting on how soft it is. And when Ayumi awakes to this, Tama leans in for a kiss and pulls up Ayumi's dress revealing her white cotton panties. Ayumi protests mildly at first, but from here... lets just say it doesn't take that long for both girls so become bare-skinned and enjoying themselves. Luckily, the guards seem to wait until their done before busting in... of course, these girls are master fighters, so the guards don't stand a chance. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the girls don't have time to get dressed before making their escape.\nBut the action's not over yet!

The series starts out all bright and cheery. Every year during her break, sixth grader \n flies out to the island where her grandparents live, and this is where we first meet sweet young lass, on board the plane about to land. So far, so good. Then, one day while she's out swimming, she decides to make the attempt at swimming out to some large posts sticking out of the water. The currents are strong, but she's never made it out there before and this will be her last year to try. It's an exhausting journey, but with all her friends cheering her on, she finally makes it. As she dives under to see what's below, she spots a strange yellow creature in the shape of a starfish, only it has big googly eyes staring right back at her! Soon, everything begins to go dark.\nTo her surprise, she wakes up on land, safe and sound. Later that night, she heads back to the beach... and who should appear, but the strange star creature. Amazed at seeing it soar through the air, it eventually swoops down and stops right beside her, still saying absolutely nothing, but apparently indicating that it's okay for her to get on. Together, they take off over the water, and high into the air! Looks like the start of a beautiful friendship! She names her adorable new pal \n. And then something strange happens... er, something stranger, I mean. Seeming out of nowhere appears a giant dragon-like creature... and standing on it's tip is a naked girl, covered in strange red symbols. Wow, what a day!\n\nBack at home, \n has begun to travel with \n where ever she goes by affixing himself to her back like a backpack. In kendo class, her instructor asks her to help a new student, \n, who appears to be very timid and lacking in self confidence. Before you know it, \n finds out that \n also has a creature like \n, though hers is white and red... and apparently, she has some kind of psychic connection to it as she can see and feel what it does. But now, here is where things start going from the bright and cheerful to dark and disturbing. It seems that \n has a hard time dealing with the emotional stress that her psychic connection causes, and she's often considered suicide. Thankfully, \n is a true friend, which is something \n needed very badly.\n\nUnfortunately, matters get worse. One day while the two are out in the woods, looking down upon the airfield where \n's father works, they encounter another creature, and this one isn't too friendly. They soon discover that this creature is controlled by another kid who appears about their age, and this kid is a real piece of work! He says that he wants to kill, kill, kill! He wants to destroy everyone he feels like to create a world where he is in complete control... and apparently he has friends who hold similar feelings. They call their creatures the dragon's children, and they all have strong psychic connections to their creatures. Strange that \n does not. Anyway, about half the episodes deal with these freaks.\n\nThen suddenly, the episodes switch to dealing first with some new girl that also has a creature, and then to the bullying of one of \n's close friends, Hiroko Kaizuka, by a groups of school girl who despise the fact that she always scores higher than them on tests. These girls are cruel to the bone, and Hiroko's father only makes things worse by blaming Hiroko's only true friend, \n, for the declining grades. All of this pushes Hiroko beyond her limits, and brings about a creature more vicious than anyone has seen before. And what's worse, Hiroku's descent into madness not only affects the girls who were tormenting her, but it spills over to put \n's father in danger. Does \n have what it takes to stop her friend before Hiroko's creature destroys her family?\nAlthough the entire series has been available on DVD since November 2005 with the release of the fourth and final disc, on July 25th Central Park Media is releasing all four discs together as a set for only $49.95.

Each show of the Force Five series would air on a specific day of the week, and Starzinger, known as Spaceketeers, aired on Wednesdays.\nThe story follows Princess Aurora and her quest to restore balance to the universe. To do this, she must travel to the great planet in the center of the galaxy, as this planet emanates an energy force which at one time maintained peace throughout the galaxy, but has now grown weak. Without this energy, cells throughout the galaxy become mutated causing peaceful aliens to turn evil and destructive. And only Princess Aurora can restore this energy.\nSounds epic! Before she sets out on her quest she is assigned a guardian, a hot-headed cyborg in named Jan Kugo (Jesse Dart in the Spaceketeers version), and she is told that on her quest she will find two other cyborg guardians that will assist in her journey. These turn out to be Don Haka and Sir Djorgo. Each of the cyborgs has a different color uniform, with Kugo being red, Haka being green, and Djorgo being blue. And then the princess is in pink, of course.\nOn August 20th, 2013 a heavily edited version of the show was released on DVD as a 3-movie collection called \n.

She barely gets those monsters squeezed inside, but you know they ain't gonna stay in there for long! Soon after she comes out from the changing room picks up a parfait to serve her first order, she stumbles slightly into a nearby teen boy who instinctively tries to catch her. Unfortunately, his actions only cause her shirt to pop open and cause her to fall onto a nearby gentleman... well, at least he seemed like a gentleman until Nami lands square on him with her large, uncovered breasts full up in face, then we learn he is actually a pervert pretending to be a gentleman. And lucky for Nami's parfait, another new waitress, the sexy blue-haired Chisato, has mad reflexes and is able to catch it before it was able to splatter all over the restaurant floor.\n\nLater that night after closing, Nami heads out with the garbage, and who does she encounter but some half-naked babe in some kind of torn-up cosplay outfit. She appears to be hurt, but before Nami can go for help the woman grabs her and hands her a strange palm-sized item that looks like some kind of eyeball pendant. The woman asks Nami to take over, and when Nami takes the pendant, the woman vanishes into thin air, leaving Nami a might confused.\n\nWhile on the train, pondering over what just happened, out of nowhere a pervert comes up behind her and starts majorly feeling her up. When Nami can take no more, a flash of light shoots out from her pendant and her clothes are astonishingly transformed into some super-skimpy super-hero type threads. Upon seeing this, a whole lot of guys on the train car lunge out to start feeling her up, and before she knows it she finds herself flying straight up and out of the moving train.\n\nNami clumsily tries to make her way home through the air, still knowing not of how in the world she is able to fly. Well, she eventually makes it there, though the ends up crashing through the window and landing right on top of her older brother, Katsuo, who happened to be doing something... private, while watching some cosplay porn. So when he sees the sight of his sister all dressed up as a cosplay girl, he starts flipping out and telling her there is no way he's going to allow that! Of course, Nami has no idea what he's talking about. She doesn't even know what's happening to her!\n\nA little later on, after Katsuo takes off, Nami's boss from the restaurant, Mr. Sasao, stops by saying that he brought a custom made uniform since hers didn't so well. He has no problem inviting himself in, even though (or should I say \"especially since\") Nami had just gotten out of a bath and only had a towel on. So he gives her the uniform, but when she goes to try it on she finds that it doesn't cover hardly anything! The super-short skirt is divided in front so her panties are clearly visible, and her \"shirt\", if that's what you can call it, barely comes down far enough to cover her nipples.\n\nOnce she has it on, Mr. Sasao has no problem barging in to see how it looks, and he likes what he sees! All of a sudden tentacles come out of his back and fly toward Nami, grabbing a hold of her arms and pinning her against the wall while he gets to take a closer look... and feel. Turns out, Mr. Sasao is actually a sex demon, and that eyeball pendant, besides allowing Nami to transform and fly, also makes her give off strong sex pheromones in order to attract sex demons! She is able to grab hold of her pendant which was lying nearby, and her transformation knocks back the demon. Before he is able to get a hold of her again, Katsuo shows up and gives Mr. Sasao a good right hook, knocking him to the floor!\n\nOf course, the demon is able to just get up and shake it off, so when it throws Katsuo against the wall, Nami stumbles and falls out the window. Good thing she was transformed, because if she would have landed on the ground, she could have been seriously hurt. As it is, she takes off flying, and Mr. Sasao, after sprouting a pair of wings, takes off after her. Nami's friend, Chisato, hears what's going on from Katsuo, and she herself transforms into a similar scantily-clad super-hero. She quickly takes flight in an attempt to locate Nami, while Katsuo just stares in amazement at the sight he just saw.\n\nWhen Chisato finally locates Nami, she is in the grasp of the sex demon, and her attempt to free the struggling blonde only ends up with her being trapped in a barrier portal, which seems to be like another dimension. Here, the sex demon continues his fun with Nami, while several other demons have some fun of their own with Chisato. When Nami sees what's happening to Chisato, she decides that she must rescue her, and then a quick flash of light later and they're no longer in the portal, and the demon appears to burst into flames. From behind the charred body, we see another sexy super heroine, with her hand held out, pointed at the exact spot where the demon's just burned away.\n\nWe soon discover additional super heroines, and a quick slaughter ensues between them and a few fairly pathetic demons. And then when only the busty girls are left standing and we think it's all over, Mr. Sasao pops up behind Nami. The girls are unable to act for fear of the demon killing her, but Nami is able to release her own weapon, a sword, and slices the demon in half!
